      "abstract": "Online freelancing is growing rapidly. Yet despite this rapid growth, we have a limited understanding of online freelancers' long-term experiences and evolution or how online freelancing influences their broader career goals. To address this gap, we interviewed a set of online freelancers at two time periods, two and a half years apart. We find that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. We find that this overhead influenced participation and perceptions over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers leveraged to manage this overhead. Our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms afforded freelancers unique career development opportunities over time: career domain exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation and skill transfer. Based on our findings, we present policy and design implications for increasing the sustainability and accessibility of online freelancing.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "This study explores whether a life metaphoric game (LMG) can effectively facilitate communication between senior participants (SPs) and young adult partners (YPs) during a life review (LR) activity. LRs provide older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences, rediscover the meaning of life, and prepare for their future life and eventual death. We held workshops in which 33 SPs (middle-aged and older adults ages 51–85) co-played a commercial game, titled “Long Journey of Life,” paired with YPs (ages 19–23). The YPs asked SPs about their associated memories during the LR activity. Through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication themes during the LR activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation, life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclose, interpretation of metaphors, and explanation of control method. We studied the relationships between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. In addition, we identified how participants’ responses to the game differ depending on the player’s characteristics and generation. Game design suggestions for an effective intergenerational LR using digital games were offered.",

      "abstract": "Algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects.  From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency.  However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants.  In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 5 years since its deployment.\r\n",

      "abstract": "As science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the requirements for comprehensive Research Data Management (RDM) grow. This often overwhelms scientists, requiring more workload and training. The failure to conduct effective RDM leads to producing research artefacts that cannot be reproduced or reused. Past research placed high value on supporting data science workers, but focused mainly on data production, collection, processing, and sensemaking. In order to understand practices and needs of data science workers in relation to documentation, preservation, sharing, and reuse, we conducted a cross-domain study with 15 scientists and data managers from diverse scientific domains. We identified five core concepts which describe common practices in generating reproducible research artefacts: Practice, Adoption, Barriers, Education, and Impact. Based on those concepts, we introduce a stage-based model of personal RDM commitment evolution. The model can be used to drive the design of future systems that support a transition to open science. We discuss infrastructure and policy involved at the stages and transitions in the model. Our work supports designers in understanding the constraints and challenges involved in designing for reproducibility in an age of data-driven science.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Online donation platforms help equalize access to opportunity and funding in cases where inequalities exist. In the context of public school education in the USA, for instance, financial inequalities have been shown to perpetuate in the educational system, where schools are primarily funded through local property taxes. In response, private charitable donation platforms such as DonorsChoose.org have emerged seeking to alleviate systemic inequity. But how effective are these platforms today in redressing existing funding inequalities across school districts? Our analysis over extensive donation data from DonorsChoose shows that such platforms are ineffective to mitigate (and may exacerbate) existing inequalities.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we explore the role of online educational charities in directing more funding towards poorer schools, without seemingly compromising their donors' freedom of choice in how they donate their private money. This question leads us to draw on the line of work on choice architectures in behavioral economics, and pose a novel research question on the impact of interface design on equity in socio-technical systems. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how simple interface design interventions, such as modifying default rankings or displaying additional information about the schools, might lead to changes in the donation distributions, which may help platforms direct funding towards schools in need. Going beyond educational charities, we hope that our work will bring into notice the role of platform designs for the social requirements of online altruism.",

      "abstract": "Understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. In this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. We find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as `but' and `except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. This work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate. ",

      "abstract": "Although continual online interaction is beneficial for an older adult with mild cognitive impairment, cybersecurity risks can become more pronounced. Prior work has touted the benefit of shared decision-making between care recipients and caregivers who may want to instill online safety and security safeguards. In this study we investigated the current online safety and security safeguarding decision-making practices of care recipients with mild cognitive impairment and their spousal caregivers. We identified a gap between optative and actual decision-making: whereas couples expressed their desire to engage in shared decision-making, the actuality was most caregivers were compelled to take sole action. We further determined that shared-decision making was not feasible as there was a lack of suitable safeguarding options along a spectrum of care for the couple to choose from. We relate these findings to prior work that highlights similar challenges and discuss how there needs to be more offered than simply an illusion of choice.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to a sharp transition from offline to online education in many countries and areas. This transition heightens the intensity of existing challenges of online education, such as student attendance and education equality. During this time of uncertainty, the vast disparities in teachers’ online experience and technical backgrounds, students’ education level and their families’ economic status, and schools’ support, further pose new challenges to teachers and students. In this work, we study how Chinese teachers and students addressed challenges during this transition. We interviewed 15 teachers and 18 students from diverse backgrounds at varying education levels (K-12 and college). Our work makes timely and new contributions to the literature of online education. For example, our results showed that teachers applied Live Video Streaming (LVS) on multiple social media platforms and re-purposed different entertainment features to deliver online teaching for better student engagement; some teachers came to enjoy this new form of instruction after being resistant to it in the beginning; and students developed a better sense of intimacy with their teachers after experiencing certain online interactions. Our work also reveals the remaining challenges and prospects of LVS-based online education and sheds light on the future design of collaborative technologies for online education.",

      "abstract": "An important concern in end user development (EUD) is accidentally embedding private information in program artifacts when sharing them. This issue is particularly important in GUI-based programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. Prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in EUD. We present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate potential personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app GUI context. Compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. Our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer’s side to preserve the shared scripts’ transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. Our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields.\r\n",

      "abstract": "As colleges and universities continue their commitment to increasing access to higher education through offering education online and at scale, attention on teaching open-ended subjects online and at scale, mainly the arts, humanities, and the social sciences, remains limited. While existing work in scaling open-ended courses primarily focuses on the evaluation and feedback of open-ended assignments, there is a lack of understanding of how to effectively teach open-ended, university-level courses at scale. To better understand the needs of teaching large-scale, open-ended courses online effectively in a university setting, we conducted a mixed-methods study with university instructors and students, using surveys and interviews, and identified five critical pedagogical elements that distinguish the teaching and learning experiences in an open-ended course from that in a non-open-ended course. An overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students' self-expression. We further uncovered open challenges and opportunities when incorporating the five critical pedagogical elements into large-scale, open-ended courses online in a university setting, and suggested six future research directions: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity.",

      "abstract": "We studied the topical preferences of social media campaigns of India's two main political parties by examining the tweets of 7382 politicians during the key phase of campaigning between Jan - May of 2019 in the run up to the 2019 general election. First, we compare the use of self-promotion and opponent attack, and their respective success online by categorizing 1208 most commonly used hashtags accordingly into the two categories. Second, we classify the tweets applying a qualitative typology to hashtags on the subjects of nationalism, corruption, religion and development. We find that the ruling BJP tended to promote itself over attacking the opposition whereas the main challenger INC was more likely to attack than promote itself. Moreover, while the INC gets more retweets on average, the BJP dominates Twitter's trends by flooding the online space with large numbers of tweets. We consider the implications of our findings hold for political communication strategies in democracies across the world.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest within CSCW community in understanding the characteristics of misinformation propagated through computational media, and the devising techniques to address the associated challenges. However, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the Global South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of Bangladesh, a country in the Global South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh, a country with a population over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people in the `news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online. However, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being published online everyday. We further find that the voluntary fact-checkers in Bangladesh are not equipped with sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. We show how our findings are connected to some of the core concerns of CSCW community around social media, collaboration, infrastructural politics, and information inequality. From our analysis, we also suggest several pathways to increase the impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design, and infrastructure development. ",

      "abstract": "While social media offer users a platform for self-expression, identity exploration, and community management, among other functions, they also offer space for religious practice and expression. In this paper, we explore social media spaces as they subtend new forms of religious experiences and rituals. We present a mixed-methods study to understand the practice of sharing Quran verses on Arabic Twitter in their cultural context by combining a quantitative analysis of the most shared Quran verses, the topics covered by these verses, and the modalities of sharing with a qualitative study of users' goals. This analysis of a set of 2.6 million tweets containing Quran verses demonstrates that online religious expression in the form of sharing Quran verses both extends offline religious life and supports new forms of religious expression by extending goals of offline worship as an expression of goals to do good deeds, give in charity, hold memorials, or show solidarity. We found that because our Arab Muslim respondents conceptualize these platforms as everlasting, at least beyond their lifetimes, social media platforms were considered to be effective for certain religious practices, such as reciting Quran, supplication (dua), and ceaseless charity. Our quantitative analysis of the most shared verses of the Quran underlines this commitment to religious expression as an act of worship, highlighting topics such as the hereafter, God's mercy, and sharia law. We note that verses on topics such as jihad are shared much less often, contradicting media representation of Muslim social media use and practice. ",

      "abstract": "Many non-profit peer-to-peer exchange arrangements and profit-driven, multi-sided online marketplaces leverage underutilized resources, such as tools, to optimize their use to capacity. They often rely on a digital platform in pursuit of their social aspirations and/or economic objectives. We report on a field study of a local sharing community that employs a set of stickers illustrating different household items, typically placed on community members' mailboxes, along with complementary digital tools. The stickers are used to communicate the availability of resources among neighbors to facilitate social encounters and to encourage sustainable use and re-use of shared resources. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with sixteen participants, we describe the opportunities and limitations of this approach to peer-to-peer exchange. We offer insights for designers of resource sharing communities into facilitating face-to-face encounters and the online interactions needed to support them.",

      "abstract": " While persuasion has often been considered as an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. This criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold, and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values are originated from and shaped by religiosity and spirituality. We join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. Based on our six-month long ethnography with the Islamic communities in a Bangladeshi city, Kushtia, we describe how `motivation' and `habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasions. Drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how Islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion, and reflect a vision of sustainable living. We further discuss how such deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living, and broaden the scope of CSCW literature in the various domains.",

      "abstract": "Messaging is a common mode of communication, with conversations written informally between individuals. Interpreting emotional affect from messaging data can lead to a powerful form of reflection or support clinical therapy. Existing analysis techniques for social media commonly use LIWC and VADER for automated sentiment estimation, which we correlate with PANAS affect scores from 25 participants. These correlations are compared to human review as an upper bound of how well an automated technique could potentially do if it had human judgment. We explore differences in how each technique works, and when they are successful, showing that human review does better than VADER, the best automated technique, when the humans are confident in their labels (0.40 correlation) or they are judging positive affect (0.48 correlation when confident, 0.31 correlation overall). Compared to prior literature, sentiment analysis techniques correlate better with PANAS scores for messaging than social media. These results mean that while any technique that serves as a proxy for PANAS scores has moderate correlation at best, there are some areas to improve the automated techniques by better considering context and timing in conversations.",

      "abstract": "Social computing provides a variety of challenges and opportunities for people who are aging. In particular, older adults sometimes engage in online communities designated for people with dementia to understand their diagnosis and gain support. In this work, we analyzed 186 posts from a seven-year period on a forum for persons with dementia to understand 1) who interacts in this forum and 2) what kinds of activities interactants engage in. Our analyses indicate that, in addition to people with dementia, a variety of dementia-related stakeholders participate in this forum. Our results also suggest that seeking and offering social support are key activities for all forum users, not just those with dementia for whom the forum was designated. Given these findings, we offer design implications for online spaces for vulnerable communities, with a focus on design that allows for external stakeholder participation while still maintaining the privacy and safety of vulnerable members of the community.",

      "abstract": "Coming out and being visible online can offer transgender and/or non-binary people benefits not found elsewhere. However, it also can expose them to stigmatizing reactions. Through an analysis of 15 semi-structured interviews, we investigate the experiences of transgender and/or non-binary people coming out across social media sites (SMSs). We found that participants employed strategies around disclosure and visibility to limit the consequences of coming out and to access support. Using trans theory on visibility, we discuss how online spaces present metaphorical \"doors\" to resources, support, and recognition---but can also be \"traps\" for those that do not meet the expectations of the space. We discuss how visibility empowered participants to create \"trapdoors\" to new spaces within SMSs where they could create positive outcomes for themselves and their communities. We close with considerations for designers as they create online spaces, and present a broader call to action for the HCI community around designing online spaces.",

In the collection phase, ImageSense offers fluid transitions between serendipitous discovery of curated images via ImageCascade, combined text- and image-based Semantic search, and intelligent AI suggestions for finding new images. For later composition and reflection, ImageSense provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. A study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers' preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process.

      "abstract": "In increasingly digitalised societies, government initiatives to ensure that public services remain accessible for everyone typically focus on the digital inclusion of older adults. However, by solely viewing older adults as passive recipients or consumers of services, digital inclusion strategies under-emphasise the concept of digital participation. Highlighting the importance of older adults as active contributors in a digital society, we investigated the potential of content creation to increase older adults’ digital skills whilst also strengthening their digital participation. Through a workshop and interviews involving three different groups of older content producers, we show that content creation can stimulate older adults’ digital participation. We report on challenges faced by the content creators, including time constraints, lack of professional support and the preference to create content collaboratively. We propose that by facilitating collaborative content creation activities, local communities can better support older adults’ digital participation and facilitate inclusion across different life domains.",

The explainable AI (XAI) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations are evaluated by experts in lab settings and challenging for layperson to understand. Less is known about how people understand and explain AI-led decisions in the community context. Drawing from XAI research and activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community’s shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-AI interaction. We then present a case study of AI-led moderation, where people who received automated punishments sought socially-oriented, system-oriented, and action-oriented explanations to develop understanding of AI decisions. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of CSCW, HCI, and XAI.",

      "abstract": "Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to undertake some action they normally would not.  While technical protections against phishing reduce the number of phishing emails received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest sources of security risk in technology and communication systems.  To better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to identify phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in their own inboxes.  IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process for identifying phishing emails. In the first stage, the email recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it relates to other things in their life.  As they do this, they notice discrepancies: little things that are ``off'' about the email. As the recipient notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an alternative explanation for the email.  At some point, some feature of the email --- usually, the presence of a link requesting an action --- triggers them to recognize that phishing is a possible alternative explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and investigate the email by looking for technical details that can conclusively identify the email as phishing.  Once they find such information, then they move to stage three and deal with the email by deleting it or reporting it.  I discuss ways this process can fail, and implications for improving training of end users about phishing.",

      "abstract": "People living with HIV experience a high level of stigma in our society. Public HIV-related stigma often leads to anxiety and depression and hinders access to social support and proper medical care. Technologies for HIV, however, have been mainly designed for treatment management and medication adherence rather than for helping people cope with public HIV-related stigma specifically. Drawing on empirical data obtained from semi-structured interviews and design activities with eight social workers and 29 people living with HIV, we unpack the ways in which needs for privacy and trust, intimacy, and social support create tensions around key coping strategies. Reflecting on these tensions, we present design implications and opportunities to empower people living with HIV to cope better with public HIV-related stigma at the individual level.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores some of the new possibilities for financial third party access that are enabled by \"open banking\". The term open banking is used to designate the availability of banks' customer data through application programming interfaces (APIs). Financial third party access refers to the mechanisms that facilitate the engagement of others in the management of our personal finances. Engaging trusted others in personal finances may be especially valuable for individuals experiencing financial hardship or life circumstances that place their financial stability at risk. We deployed a new third party access tool enabled by the UK Open Banking APIs for 90 days with 14 people who self-identified as living with a mental health condition. The tool, which was developed by a financial technology startup founded by the second author, allowed participants to select a trusted \"ally\" who was notified when certain transactions took place in participants' bank accounts. During the deployment, the 14 participants and 8 of their \"allies\" took part in a diary study and pre- and post-deployment interviews. The experiences of our participants reveal the inadequacy and shortcomings of existing formal third party access mechanisms, and the moneywork involved in financial third party access. We argue that focusing on this moneywork can help us design flexible, proportionate and practice-sensitive services for financial third party access that move beyond discourses of protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Online feedback exchange platforms enable content creators to collect a diverse set of design feedback quickly. However, creators can experience low quality and harsh feedback when using such platforms. In this paper, we leverage the empathy of the feedback provider to address both these issues. Specifically, we tested two narrative-based empathy arousal interventions: a negative experience and a design process narrative. We also examined whether ingroup framing further enhances the effects of empathy arousal. In a 3x2 online experiment, participants (n=205) wrote feedback on a poster design after experiencing one of the intervention conditions or a control condition. Our results show both the design process narrative and ingroup framing conditions significantly increased the feedback quality and effort invested in the task. The negative experience narrative condition had similar effects and participants reported significantly increased disapproval towards harsh feedback. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of feedback exchange platforms.",

      "abstract": "Digital data pervades everyday life, from photos shared on social media to voice commands to Amazon Alexa. However, a widespread industry culture of “move fast and break things” has compelled data management practices that prioritize profit over appraisal. This paper draws from archival theory to radically reconsider data stewardship practices that reject data storage as neutral or objective, and instead foreground control, power, subjectivity, and emotion. We draw on postmodern archival theory that recognizes the archive as a powerful and subjective curator of identity and memory. The theoretical basis of archival appraisal practices, in turn, establishes the value of the archival record which determines the need to save it. With appraisal theory as a backbone, we conducted an interview study with older adults (N=17), ages 51-72, who are in a life stage of making transitional decisions about the experiences and memories that are worth keeping or discarding. We sketch data management paths, drawn from archival theory, that forefront legacy, life transitions, precarity, and control. ",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Narratives are fundamental to our perception of the world and are pervasive in all activities that involve the representation of events in time. Yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. This article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. We make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation, metaphor, and visualization. Evaluation results indicate that the Narrative Map representation is a powerful method to communicate complex narratives to individuals. Our findings have implications for intelligence analysts, computational journalists, and misinformation researchers.",

We report our findings of interviews conducted with 16 Saudi Arabian parents (8 fathers, 6 mothers and 1 couple). We generate qualitative themes that provide insights about how parents wanted to preserve their values, integrate technology into the traditional process and protect their young adults from potential harms. These themes lead to implications for designing suitable marital matchmaking technologies in Saudi Arabia and opportunities for future work.",

      "abstract": "Reliable and accurate planning is essential for modern knowledge workers. However, there is limited insight about when, how and why planning is inaccurate, and the circumstances in which those inaccuracies are troublesome. To investigate this, we asked 20 academics to keep a diary for a single work day. They estimated the duration of the tasks they wanted to achieve at the start of the day and noted down in detail the tasks they actually achieved during the day. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to  complement this diary data. The diaries showed that some tasks, such as email and coding, were more susceptible to time underestimation bias while other tasks, such as writing and planning, were more susceptible to time overestimation bias in planning. Based on interviews, a typology of common reasons for delays in planned daily work is presented. It suggests that vague and optimistic planning leads to the observed discrepancy between planned and actual work. Finally, interviews suggested that participants adopted four planning strategies that vary in the frequency of planning, from minimal planning to daily, weekly and multi-level planning. We close by discussing ways support systems for accurate planning can be better designed for different use cases. ",

      "abstract": "Commercial activity trackers are increasingly being designed for children as young as 4 years old. However, we have limited understanding of family use practices around these trackers. To provide a big picture how families naturally use activity trackers towards collaborative management of family health, we systematically identified 9 trackers designed for children available on 4 consumer electronics retailers. Our data is composed of 2,628 user reviews both from the consumer retailers (for the wearables) and mobile application stores (for the associated apps). Our findings indicate children’s and parents’ collaborative use of these technologies beyond health and wellness. Children enjoy practicing independence and rewards while contributing to family health management and daily life requirements. Parents expect these devices to ease their life and to teach their children to become more responsible for their health, daily tasks, and schedule. However, the current designs give limited agency on child’s side and require parents’ active participation for wearable-app coordination.  For these reasons, they do not fully address parents’ expectations in decreasing their workload. On the other hand, they have the potential to facilitate family interaction with challenges structured around the data reported through trackers. ",

Older adults and their adult children who live apart often communicate about these experiences to stay aware of each other’s health and wellbeing. In this paper, we examine current practices surrounding the communication of eating habits and meal preparation between older adults and their adult children living apart. We interviewed 18 older parents and nine adult children to understand their experiences. While most participants found the sharing of eating experiences to be rewarding and enlightening of family health behaviors, family roles and contexts could create tensions around this type of conversation. Building on the lens of symbolic interactionism, we examine how changing roles and contexts influence the conversation of eating and meal preparation and how participants manage these tensions. We discuss future design opportunities to support family collaboration, accounting for the transition of roles and contexts.",

Through a qualitative, empirical study with 21 participants we examine the cultural and patriarchal framework where shame and fear of defamation restrict the seeking of support for personal narratives around taboo subjects like abortion, sexual harassment, rape and domestic abuse. Based on our qualitative data we also conduct a participatory design activity with 15 low-income, low-literate women to explore the specific design of peer-support technologies for support seeking and the sharing of sensitive and taboo narratives in a deeply patriarchal society. The design concerns raised by our participants regarding privacy, anonymity and safety provide CSCW researchers with valuable guidelines about designing for social connections and support for vulnerable populations within a particular context.

      "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. While the effects of AR experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of AR on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. Educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. However, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. In this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. We use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. We investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants’ proximity to resources. We find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. Detailed analysis shows that AR strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. Furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. We discuss the implications of these results for designing AR and non-AR collaborative interfaces.",

When designing these applications, is it better to offer: a) advice that if strictly adhered to is more likely to result in an individual successfully achieving their goal, even if fewer users will choose to adopt it? or b) advice that is likely to be adopted by a larger number of users, but which is sub-optimal with regard to any particular individual achieving their goal? We identify this dilemma, characterized as Goal-Directed vs. Adoption-Directed advice, and investigate the design questions it raises through an online experiment undertaken in four advice domains (financial investment, making healthier lifestyle choices, route planning, training for a 5k run), with three user types, and across two levels of uncertainty. We report findings that suggest a preference for advice favoring individual goal attainment over higher user adoption rates, albeit with significant variation across advice domains; and discuss their design implications.",

      "trackId": 11080,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Recent literature has demonstrated the limited and, in some instances, waning role of ethical training in computing classes in the US. The capacity for AI to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it’s an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. The question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to  recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing AI technologies, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction—from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice to public benefits distribution, and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. The US is a mecca of information and computer science learning for Asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds artificial intelligence (AI) bias. Our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design AI systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that work to heighten risk for vulnerable groups. In this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an AI class and 9 from a Data Mining class. We find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of AI design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. When they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of AI. While they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy “work.” Notably, the students who do more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias and the interaction with context. Our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about AI, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into computer science and data science curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course.

      "abstract": "Digital technology that is prevalent in people's everyday lives, including smart home devices, mobile apps and social media, increasingly lack regulations for how the user data can be collected, used or disseminated. The CSCW and the larger computing community continue to evaluate and understand the potential negative impacts of research involving digital technologies. As more research involves digital data, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) take on the difficult task of evaluating and determining risks--likelihood of potential harms--from digital research. Learning more about IRBs' role in concretizing harm and its likelihood will help us critically examine the current approach to regulating digital research, and has implications for how researchers can reflect on their own data practices. We interviewed 22 U.S.-based IRB members and found that, for the interviewees, \"being digital\" was a risk itself. Being digital meant increasing possibilities of confidentiality breach, unintended collection of sensitive information, and unauthorized data reuse. Concurrently, interviewees found it difficult to pinpoint the direct harms. The ambiguous, messy, and situated contexts of digital research data did not fit neatly into current human subjects research protection protocols. We discuss potential solutions for understanding risks of digital technology and implications for the responsibilities of the CSCW and the larger computing community in conducting digital research.",

Prior work indicates that visualization and sensemaking support may be beneficial in such processes where reviewers must present the \"story\" of the applicant under question.  We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling. Based on these workshops, we contribute a characterization for how reviewers in this domain construct visual stories, we provide guidance for designing for evidence capture and storytelling, and we draw parallels and distinctions between this domain and other reviewing domains.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Sensor enabled computers in the form of ‘IoT’ devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. With their embedded cameras and microphones, this ‘invasion’ of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. Because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as ‘turning the camera off’), these devices may still record information. With the ambiguities of current designs a bystander’s perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. Indeed, being able to assess one’s actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one’s privacy according to Altman’s theory of privacy regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. Building on this theory in the context of IoT devices, we introduce the concept of ‘tangible privacy’ as being essential to boundary regulation. We argue that IoT devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them. We conducted an interview study to understand the gap between people’s perceived and actual privacy for current IoT devices. Through an understanding of participants’ perceptions and their privacy coping mechanisms as bystanders in the face of uncertainty, we make actionable design recommendations for designers of future IoT devices. Our work thus provides empirical and theoretical contributions to the understanding of people’s interactions with IoT devices and design considerations for providing strong – tangible – privacy assurances to bystanders.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Esports commentating, the practice of reporting, explaining, and elaborating live competitive gameplay to spectators, is a centerpiece of esports as a rapidly growing spectator sport and an essential component of today's growing gaming/live streaming ecosystem. In particular, esports commentators face three unique challenges: the preparation for conducting real time commentating on highly dynamic esports games; the complexity of in-the-moment decisions during the game's broadcast; and the balance between personal self-presentation and professional content presentation. Yet this emerging and novel sociotechnical practice and how these challenges affect esports commentators' live performance and self-presentation practices has received relatively little research attention in HCI and CSCW. In this paper, we endeavor to address these limitations by empirically analyzing 19 esports commentators' sociotechnical practices. Our findings highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating as well as the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators' self-presentation. In order to execute seamless and spontaneous commentary, commentators must be studious and engage in much prior research and have a clear sense of self. We contribute to the growing CSCW literature on esports commentating practices by revealing esports commentators' unique decision making process presenting information and their self-image.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Domestic and personal photography are topics of longstanding interest to CSCW and HCI researchers. In this paper, we explore these topics in Bungoma County, Kenya. We used interview and observation methods to investigate how photographs are taken, displayed, organized, and shared, in 23 rural households. To more deeply understand participants’ photography practices, we also gave them digital cameras, observed what they did with them, and asked them to engage in a photo-elicitation exercise. Our findings draw attention to the ways photographs are “relational objects” – that is, material objects that support the maintenance, reproduction, and transformation of social relations. We then describe these relations: economic (i.e., working as cameramen producing and distributing printed images); family (i.e., parents and children using printed images to tell family histories); and community (i.e., people using printed images to present an idealized self). The introduction of digital cameras into these households did not appear to change these practices; instead, it reinforced them. We discuss how considering relational objects in CSCW/HCI is useful for balancing the technologically determinist perspectives that are the basis of many prior studies of photography in these fields. In particular, we detail how considering the concept provides new perspectives on materiality, as well an alternative to the individualistic perspective, which underlies these communities’ understanding of photography.",

Our first aim is to identify the common vision skills needed for both scenarios. To do so, we analyze the need for four vision skills—object recognition, text recognition, color recognition, and counting—on over 27,000 visual questions from two datasets representing both scenarios. We next quantify the difficulty of these skills for both humans and computers on both datasets. Finally, we propose a novel task of predicting what vision skills are needed to answer a question about an image. Our results reveal (mis)matches between aims of real users of such services and the focus of the AI community. We conclude with a discussion about future directions for addressing the visual question answering task.",

Using Black feminist epistemologies as a theoretical framework and auto-ethnography and testimonial authority as both methodology and epistemic resistance, the authors exercise epistemic agency to testify to their lived intersectional experiences and the various fronts on which they fight to be seen, to be heard, and to live.  Additionally, they advocate for more inclusionary policies of Black women and other marginalized populations within the CSCW and HCI communities. We conclude with a call to action for both communities: 1) to stand in solidarity with Blacks in computing; and 2) to acknowledge, disavow and dismantle Whiteness and oppressive power structures in the field of computing, specifically HCI and CSCW.",

      "abstract": "To increase capacity and safety in air traffic control, digital strip systems have superseded paper strips in lower airspace control centers in Europe. Previous ethnographic studies on paper strip systems anticipated a radical change in work practices with digital strip systems, but we are not aware of any studies that evaluated these predictions. We carried out contextual inquiries with controllers and focused on face-to-face and radio communication, interactions with the digital strip system and the workspace in general. In turn, we contribute (1) detailed descriptions of controllers’ work practices, such as using tacit information from radio communication and ‘standard advocates vs. tinkerers’ operation modes, (2) respective implications for design and (3) discuss how the observed work practices are similar or different from the reported practices in the literature of the two preceding decades. Our key insights are, that documentation speed is faster with digital strips, although a high load in the case of radio frequency persists. Controllers retrieve tacit information from the radio communication and combine it with scattered cues from several displays to form empathic decisions that sometimes exceed the standard protocol. We conclude that the role of tacit information holds opportunities for future flight systems and should be considered in a holistic approach to individualized workspaces for controllers.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "We propose a data-driven approach to  detect conversational groups by identifying spatial arrangements typical of these focused social encounters. Our approach uses a novel Deep Affinity Network (DANTE) to predict the likelihood that two individuals in a scene are part of the same conversational group, considering their social context. The predicted pair-wise affinities are then used in a graph clustering framework to identify both small (e.g., dyads) and large groups. The results from our evaluation on multiple, established benchmarks suggest that combining powerful deep learning methods with classical clustering techniques can improve the detection of conversational groups in comparison to prior approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a human-robot interaction scenario. Our efforts show that our work advances group detection not only in theory, but also in practice.",

      "abstract": "Corporations are increasingly empowering employees to hire on-demand workers via freelance platforms. We interviewed full-time employees of a global technology company who hired freelancers as part of their job responsibilities. While there has been prior work describing freelancers' perspectives there has been little research on those that hire them, the \"clients\", especially in the corporate context. We found that while freelance platforms reduce many administrative burdens, there are number of conditions in which using freelance platforms in a corporate context creates high transaction costs and power asymmetries that make it difficult for clients to negotiate work rights and responsibilities. This leads corporate employee clients to feel \"stuck in the middle\" between their employer, the platform, and the freelancer. Ultimately, these transactions costs are a potential barrier to wider adoption. If corporations want to leverage the value of the freelance economy then better guardrails, guidelines, and perhaps even creative technology solutions will be needed.",

      "abstract": "Peer production projects involve people in many tasks, from editing articles to analyzing datasets. To facilitate mastery of these practices, projects offer a number of learning resources, ranging from project-defined FAQs to individually-oriented search tools and communal discussion boards. However, it is not clear which project resources best support participant learning, overall and at different stages of engagement. We draw on Sørensen's framework of forms of presence to distinguish three types of engagement with learning resources:  authoritative, agent-centered and communal.  We assigned resources from the Gravity Spy citizen-science into these three categories and analyzed trace data recording interactions with resources using a mixed-effects logistic regression with volunteer performance as an outcome variable. The findings suggest that engagement with authoritative resources (e.g., those constructed by project organizers) facilitates performance initially. However, as tasks become more difficult, volunteers seek and benefit from engagement with their own agent-centered resources and community-generated resources. These findings suggest a broader scope for the design of learning resources for peer production. ",

      "abstract": "People often do not receive the engagement or responses they desire when they share on broad social media platforms. Sharers are hesitant to share trivial accomplishments, and the emphasis on data often results posts that audiences find repetitive or unengaging. Ephemeral social media’s focus on self-authored content and sharing trivial accomplishments has the potential to ameliorate these challenges. We explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. We examine the effect of a sticker’s presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants. We uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make ephemeral content more informative and entertaining, discussing implications for platforms and tools.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge building is a prevalent feature in open online systems, while it is challenging to motivate participants to contribute and maintain quality in participants' contribution. Open online competitions, where participants compete with knowledge artifacts and quality contributions are being sourced, offer a potential design model for online system to increase contribution to community knowledge. However, it remains unclear how and why participants of online competitions contribute to knowledge shared by the community. In this study, through interviews with 14 participants of Kaggle Competitions, we investigated participants' motivations, practices and challenges when contributing to community knowledge under a competition structure. We found that competitive mechanisms impact expert and beginner participants very differently in their knowledge building behaviors. Experts contribute to shared knowledge in order to compete for reputation, while they tend to form their own niches and only share knowledge artifacts that are abstract and not usable by less experienced participants. Beginners are often driven away from contributing to shared knowledge because of their vulnerable social image and low visibility resulted from competitive mechanisms. We leveraged Scardamalia 's framework on Knowledge Building Community to discuss the different challenges and opportunities that competitive design brings to expert and beginner participants. We offer design implications for effectively implementing competitive mechanisms that could benefit both expert and beginner participants in future knowledge building systems.",

We look at contribution diversity from the perspective of gender in a domain with near gender parity: graphic design. Through content analysis of 330 answers from two popular Q&A sites and semi-structured interviews with 24 graphic designers, we examine who is contributing, what content, how the community shows appreciation towards their answers, and perceived motivations and barriers to participation. We find that despite gender balance in the field, women contribute far less frequently than men. We also see gender differences in contribution styles and user appreciation. Our interviews shed further light on how Q&A community cultures might be impacting men and women differently and how design choices made by the sites’ developers might be exacerbating these differences. We suggest implications for design for improving gender inclusivity.",

      "abstract": "Via audiovisual communications and a controllable physical embodiment, Mobile Robotic telePresence (MRP) systems aim to support enhanced collaboration between remote and local members of a given setting. But MRP systems also put the remote user in positions where they frequently rely on the help of local partners. Getting or ‘recruiting’ such help can be done with various verbal and embodied actions ranging in explicitness. In this paper, we look at how such recruitment occurs in video data drawn from an experiment where pairs of participants (one local, one remote) performed a timed searching task. We find a prevalence of implicit recruitment methods and outline obstacles to effective recruitment that emerge due to communicative asymmetries that are built into MRP design. In a future where remote work becomes widespread, assistance through remote work technology like MRPs needs close examination at a fundamental interactional level, taking into account how communicative asymmetries are at play in everyday use of such technologies.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Job burnout is a special type of work-related stress that is prevalent in our modern society, and constant burnout is extremely harmful for people’s physical health and emotional wellbeing. Traditional studies for burnout mainly rely on surveys/questionnaires, which have revealed several interesting findings but are of high cost and very time consuming. With the prevalence of social networking applications, we aim to re-investigate the burnout phenomenon in a novel perspective. In this paper, we collected a dataset consisting of 1532 burnout Weibo users with their postings. Based on the previous literature, we propose a number of hypotheses about what might be the burst signal of the burnout from the perspective of language, time and interaction. Furthermore, extensive correlation analysis is conducted to investigate if these hypotheses are supported, which leads to a number of interesting findings. Finally, we develop machine learning models to predict the burst of burnout based on extracted features and achieve a relatively high accuracy, which reveals potential implications in early-stage intervention.",

      "abstract": "Social conformity occurs when individuals in group settings change their personal opinion to be in agreement with the majority’s position. While recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. This study aims to understand how social presence i.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. Acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs. user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs. no discussion), and response visibility (public vs. private). Our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self-confidence on personal answer. Furthermore, we observe an interaction effect between interactivity and response visibility, such that conformity is highest in the presence of peer discussion and public responses, and lowest when these two elements are absent. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings in designing online group settings, accounting for the effects of social presence on conformity.",

In particular, prior observational work sought to identify attributes and behaviors of individuals that correlate to their conversational efficiency. However, translating such correlations to causal interpretations is a necessary step in using them in a prescriptive fashion.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we formally describe the problem of drawing causal links between conversational behaviors and outcomes. We focus on the task of determining an effective assignment policy for a text-based crisis counseling platform: how to best assign counselors based on their behavioral tendencies exhibited in their past conversations. We apply arguments derived from causal inference to underline key challenges that arise in conversational settings where randomized trials are hard to implement. Finally, we show how to circumvent these inference challenges in our particular domain, and illustrate the potential benefits of an assignment policy informed by the resulting prescriptive information.

      "abstract": "With the ongoing debate on `freedom of speech' vs. `hate speech,' there is an urgent need to carefully understand the consequences of the inevitable culmination of the two, i.e., `freedom of hate speech' over time. An ideal scenario to understand this would be to observe the effects of hate speech in an (almost) unrestricted environment. Hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on Gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. We first generate temporal snapshots of Gab from millions of posts and users. Using these temporal snapshots, we compute an activity vector based on DeGroot model to identify hateful users. The amount of hate speech in Gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hateful at an increased and faster rate. Further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the Gab network. Also, the language used by the community as a whole seem to correlate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones. We discuss how, many crucial design questions in CSCW open up from our work.",

      "abstract": "User beliefs about algorithmic systems are constantly co-produced through user interaction and the complex socio-technical systems that generate recommendations. Identifying these beliefs is crucial because they influence how users interact with recommendation algorithms. With no prior work on user beliefs of algorithmic video recommendations, practitioners lack relevant knowledge to improve the user experience of such systems. To address this problem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with middle-aged YouTube video consumers to analyze their user beliefs about the video recommendation system. Our analysis revealed different factors that users believe influence their recommendations. Based on these factors, we identified four groups of user beliefs: Previous Actions, Social Media, Recommender System, and Company Policy. Additionally, we propose a framework to distinguish the four main actors that users believe influence their video recommendations: the current user, other users, the algorithm, and the organization. This framework provides a new lens to explore design suggestions based on the agency of these four actors. It also exposes a novel aspect previously unexplored: the effect of corporate decisions on the interaction with algorithmic recommendations. While we found that users are aware of the existence of the recommendation system on YouTube, we show that their understanding of this system is limited.",

      "abstract": "Makerspaces have complex access control requirements and are increasingly protected through digital access control mechanisms (e.g., keycards, transponders). However, it remains unclear how space administrators craft access control policies, how existing technical infrastructures support and fall short of access needs, and how these access control policies impact end-users in a makerspace. We bridge this gap through a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder study. Specifically, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with makerspace administrators across the U.S. along with a survey of 48 makerspace end-users. We found four factors influenced administrators’ construction of access control policies: balancing safety versus access; logistics; prior experience; and, the politics of funding. Moreover, administrators often made situational exceptions to their policies: e.g., during demand spikes, to maintain a good relationship with their staff, and if they trusted the user(s) requesting an exception. Conversely, users expressed frustration with the static nature of access control policies, wishing for negotiability and for social nuance to be factored into access decisions. The upshot is that existing mechanisms for access control in makerspaces are often inappropriately static and socially unaware.",

      "abstract": "Similar to a design process for designing graphical user interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with users, reviewing user data, and improving the design. While it is possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on specific conversational components. These limitations hinder designers from running rapid iterations and making informed design decisions. We posit that involving a crowd in the conversation design process can address these challenges, and introduce ProtoChat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to support the iterative process of conversation design. ProtoChat makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current conversation within the design tool. ProtoChat's crowd-testing tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the conversation. With the data collected from crowd-testing, ProtoChat provides multiple types of visualizations to help designers analyze and revise their design. Through a three-day study with eight designers, we found that ProtoChat enabled an iterative design process for designing a chatbot. Designers improved their design by not only modifying the conversation design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting UI design implications beyond the conversation design itself. The crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs, contexts, and diverse response formats. With ProtoChat, designers can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design. \r\n",

      "abstract": "The Wizard of Oz method is an increasingly common practice in HCI and CSCW studies as part of iterative design processes for interactive systems. Instead of designing a fully-fledged system, the `technical work' of key system components is completed by human operators yet presented to study participants as if computed by a machine. However, little is known about how Wizard of Oz studies are interactionally and collaboratively achieved in situ by researchers and participants. By adopting an ethnomethodological perspective, we analyse our use of the method in studies with a voice-controlled vacuum robot and two researchers present. We present data that reveals how such studies are organised and presented to participants and unpack the coordinated orchestration work that unfolds `behind the scenes' to complete the study. We examine how the researchers attend to participant requests and technical breakdowns, and discuss the performative, collaborative, and methodological nature of their work. We conclude by offering insights from our application of the approach to others in the HCI and CSCW communities for using the method.\r\n",

      "trackId": 11079,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. One promising application for chatbots is to elicit people' self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts and feelings. As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three  chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if  they would like to share  their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the options of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic, “crowdroar” experience offered in some channels to the close-knit, “participatory communities” within others. How do livestreaming communities support the types of meaningful conversation and connection that lead to relationship development, and when? In this paper, we explore the development of personal relationships within Twitch, a popular livestreaming platform. Interviews with 21 pairs whose initial meetings occurred within Twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in Twitch’s text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can develop into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. Consistent with Walther’s model of hyperpersonal interaction [ref], these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, and frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions, and, as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of 1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of channels as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these findings provide a vivid demonstration of how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. We consider implications for the design and management of online communities which intend to foster the creation of close relationships among their members.",

      "abstract": "Research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like Wikipedia, Facebook Groups, and Reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. In this work we review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for both new and established researchers studying community self-moderation. We contrast community-based moderation research with institutional agent-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. We provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion.",

      "abstract": "To better understand how we can broaden participation in computing, this exploratory study examines the interview process for elite internships at established technology companies. Through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. These evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. By reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators’ assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. Given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. We conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in hiring. ",

While human-AI collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of AI teammates in human-AI teaming. To achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive AI teammates and what they expect from AI teammates in human-AI teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. Considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-AI teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. This study shows that people have mixed feelings toward AI teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with AI teammates in general. Our findings highlight people's expectations for AI teammates in a rapidly changing collaborative environment (e.g., instrumental skills for in-game tasks, shared understanding between humans and AI, communication capabilities, human-like behaviors and performance), as well as factors that impact people's willingness to team up with AI teammates (e.g., pre-existing attitudes toward AI, previous collaboration experience with humans). We contribute to CSCW by shedding light on how AI should be structured in human-AI teaming to support highly complex collaborative activities in CSCW environments.",

      "abstract": "For adult newcomers to countries such as Canada, learning language is more than an academic task. Language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. Many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. To explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in English, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. Post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. We discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities.",

      "abstract": "Despite slow adoption in the West, mobile payments are the de facto solution for hundreds of millions of users in China for everything from paying bills to riding buses, from sending virtual ``Red Packets'' to buying money market funds. In this paper, we use the theoretical lens of infrastructure to study users' interactions with ubiquitous and embedded mobile payment systems in China, focusing on Alipay and WeChat Pay, the two dominant apps on the market. Based on data from a survey (n=466) and follow-up interviews (n=12) with users in China, we describe the diverse usage patterns across physical, social, and digital ubiquity, and a series of challenges people face. Reflecting on the lessons we learned from the Chinese case, in particular problems and pitfalls, we discuss some implications both for design and for policy. Our findings have important implications for other countries that have been moving towards greater adoption of mobile payments.",

      "abstract": "Trans people often use social media to connect with others, find and share resources, and post transition-related content. However, because most social media platforms are not built with trans people in mind and because online networks include people who may not accept one's trans identity, sharing trans content can be difficult. We studied Trans Time, a social media site developed particularly for trans people to document transition and build community. We interviewed early Trans Time users (N = 6) and conducted focus groups with potential users (N = 21) to understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users. We found that Trans Time has the potential to be a safe space, encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to selectively view content using content warnings. Together, these aspects create an online space where trans people can simultaneously build community, find support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans life. Yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the site can improve. We provide implications for how social media sites may better support both trans users, as well as insular communities of people from other marginalized groups.",

In this paper, we consider the role that data visualizations play in grounding discussion around a civic issue, through an analysis of how people talk about climate change data in the comment threads at three news websites (i.e., Breitbart news, the Guardian, the New York Times).  We find that out of 6,525 comments, only 2.4% reference data visualizations in the articles.  While rare, the paper presents illustrative examples of how people refer to data---their collection, analysis, and visual representation---to engage with an article's narrative.  A text classification analysis demonstrates how we might automatically highlight data-centered talk and use data as building blocks for more effective online discussion.",

Failure to manage such information can have critical consequences for the financial and psychological well-being of the family; however, little is known about how families manage the full scale of information in the home. We introduce family information management (FIM) as a set of overarching practices involved in managing and coordinating household-related information. To understand how families engage in FIM, we conducted in-depth interviews with members of ten families, which included guided tours of their information archives. We found that families struggle to organize, store, retrieve, and share information, and that there are significant socioemotional costs to this work. We propose opportunities for designing technologies to support FIM and argue that, given the numerous challenges and unmet needs, the understudied area of FIM deserves further investment of research and design efforts.",

      "abstract": "One promise of commons-based peer production systems is that they provide content (e.g., text, images, sounds, lines of code) for “anyone to use, edit, and distribute.” However, when some kinds of content are stripped of context and made available for reuse, there are several knock-on effects. In this paper, we discuss how these knock-on effects can complicate the illustration of Wikipedia’s encyclopedic articles. We focus on the particularly difficult case of illustrating articles about female anatomy and women’s health. Through our analysis, we demonstrate several barriers to illustrating these kinds of articles, including a lack of representative images on Wikimedia Commons, complex issues of consent, and editorial disagreements about the intended audiences for such images. We argue that these barriers are, in part, the unanticipated effects of decontextualization and subsequent recontextualization as images are removed from their original contexts and made available in Wikimedia Commons. Drawing on prior work in language acquisition and archival studies, we critique the design of commons-based peer production systems and suggest ways in which they might be re-designed to account better for the nuances of context. Finally, we raise questions about the costs of recontextualization in peer production systems in general.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "While mobile instant messaging (MIM) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. We examine two design concepts for MIM---private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications---that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. Private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. Sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. We built MyButler, an Android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with KakaoTalk, a commercial MIM app. During a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. Participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. We reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in MIM communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of MIM users in choosing whether to alert their messages. In terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. We found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. Based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",

      "abstract": "Live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. Participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream’s characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. To understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and 12 viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. Among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. Nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. For example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. Based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design modifications that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment.",

      "abstract": "The interpretation of data is fundamental to machine learning. This paper investigates practices of image data annotation as performed in industrial contexts. We define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. Previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators’ subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. We propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. We analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. Our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. Arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. This imposition is largely naturalized. Assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. This paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society.",

      "abstract": "Modeling politeness across cultures helps to improve intercultural communication by uncovering what is considered appropriate and polite. We study the linguistic features associated with politeness across US English and Mandarin Chinese. First, we annotate 5,300 Twitter posts from the US and 5,300 Sina Weibo posts from China for politeness scores. Next, we develop an English and Chinese politeness feature set, `PoliteLex'. Combining it with validated psycholinguistic dictionaries, we then study the correlations between linguistic features and perceived politeness across cultures. We find that on Mandarin Weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered to be more polite than on English Twitter. Death-related taboo topics, lack of or poor choice of pronouns, and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on Mandarin Weibo compared to English Twitter. Finally, we build language-based machine learning models to predict politeness with an F1 score of 0.886 on Mandarin Weibo and a 0.774 on English Twitter.",

      "abstract": "Time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon can contribute to short-term continuation while long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies used in a project and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.",

However, existing frameworks do not produce high quality results with non-expert crowdworkers, especially for scenarios where objects split.  To address this shortcoming, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform called CrowdMOT, and investigate two micro-task design decisions: (1) whether to decompose the task so that each worker is in charge of annotating all objects in a sub-segment of the video versus annotating a single object across the entire video, and (2) whether to show annotations from previous workers to the next individuals working on the task.  Our experiments highlight strategies for efficiently collecting higher quality annotations than observed using today's state-of-art crowdsourcing system for a greater diversity of videos, which show both familiar objects (aka - people) and unfamiliar objects (aka - cells).",

      "abstract": "This paper studies data work in an organizational context, and suggests speculative data work as a useful concept and the speculative dashboard as a design artefact, to better understand and support cooperative work. Drawing on fieldwork in a Danish public sector organisation, the paper identifies and conceptualizes the speculative data work performed around processes of digitalization and the push to become data-driven. The speculative dashboard is proposed as a potential design artefact, using practices from speculative design and research to facilitate speculation about data–its sources, visualizations, practices and infrastructures. It does so by hacking the ‘genre’ of the business intelligence data dashboard, and using it as a framework for the juxtaposition of different kinds of data, facilitating and encouraging speculation on alternative visions for data types and use. The paper contributes an empirical study of organizational use of and attitudes towards data, informing a novel design method and potential artefact for co-speculating on alternative visions of and for organizational data.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Over 35% of the world’s population uses social media. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have radically impacted the way individuals interact and communicate. These platforms facilitate both public and private communication with strangers and friends alike, providing rich insight into an individual’s personality, health, and wellbeing. To date, researchers have employed a variety of methods for extracting mental health-centric features from digital text communication data, including natural language processing, social network analysis, and extraction of temporal discourse patterns. However, none have explored a hierarchical framework for extracting features from private messages with the goal of unifying approaches across methodological domains. Furthermore, while analyses of large, public corpora abound in existing literature, limited work has been done to explore the relationship between of private textual communications, personality traits, and symptoms of mental illness. We present a framework for constructing rich feature spaces from digital text communications. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by applying it to a sample of private Facebook messages in a college student population (N = 103). Our results reveal key individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as language usage in relation to validated measures of trait-level anxiety, loneliness, and personality. By leveraging the comprehensive structure outlined by our framework, we not only built more complete models of private social media discourse but also demonstrated the associated affordances with respect to classifying mental health. This work represents a critical step forward in linking features of private social media messages to validated measures of mental health and wellbeing.",

In this work, we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all discussion points. We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries—artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. We conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with Google Docs.\r\nWe found that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. A second study demonstrated that in larger groups, Wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools.",

      "abstract": "Medical practices have always been data oriented: healthcare providers decisions are based on data, both clinically generated and patient reported. With the increased use of patient-generated health data (PGHD), other types of data are entering providers’ practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. We studied the use of PGHD and its related data practices in the context of fertility, a health concern that is uncertain, complex, and data intensive. We interviewed 14 patients who are facing or have faced challenges to conceive and 5 healthcare providers specialized in infertility. Our findings show that patients and providers use PGHD in different ways but with the common goal of exploring “the unknown” generated by the uncertainties of fertility. Providers use patients’ data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify possible causes of infertility and define a treatment course. Patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with data interpretation challenges. By analyzing these data practices, we discuss the principles behind their differences and describe how they have individual benefits for each specific group. We then suggest that fertility technologies need to consider such principles, highlight the existing boundary between patients’ and providers’ data practices, and focus on bridging instead of merging them in order to facilitate collaboration and maintain their independent benefits.",

Yet, empirical research has largely studied conspiracy theory adoption as an individual pursuit, rather than as a socially mediated process. What makes users join communities endorsing and spreading conspiracy theories? We leverage longitudinal data from 56 conspiracy communities on Reddit to compare individual and social factors determining which users join the communities. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we first identify 30K future conspiracists-(FC) and 30K matched non-conspiracists-(NC). We then provide empirical evidence of importance of social factors across six dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million Reddit comments and posts. Specifically in social factors, we find that dyadic interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization outside of the conspiracy communities, are the most important social precursors to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines. Our results offer quantitative backing to understand social processes and echo chamber effects in conspiratorial engagement, with important implications for democratic institutions and online communities.",

In this article I use interviews with r/AskHistorians moderators and community members, observation, and the full comment log of a highly upvoted thread to describe the impact of Reddit's design and culture on moderation work. Results show that visible moderation work that is often interpreted as censorship, and the default masculine whiteness of Reddit create challenges for moderators who use the subreddit as a public history site. Nonetheless, r/AskHistorians moderators have carved a space on Reddit where, through their public scholarship work, the community serves as a model for combating misinformation by building trust in academic processes.

      "trackId": 11079,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Online multiplayer games like Minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. Research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like Minecraft. However, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., Easterbrook et al., 1993). In fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions, for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in  facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. We discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. It is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. This paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. Between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants’ normalized learning gain, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. However, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. Because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. Results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. These findings provide insight on women’s experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive.",

      "abstract": "Live streaming services allow people to concurrently consume and comment on media events with other people in real time. Durkheim’s theory of “collective effervescence” suggests that face-to-face encounters in ritual events conjure emotional arousal, so people often feel happier and more excited while watching events like the Super Bowl with family and friends through the television than if they were alone. Does a stronger emotional intensity also occur in live streaming? Using a large-scale dataset of comments posted to news and media events on YouTube, we address this question by examining emotional intensity in live comments versus those produced retrospectively. Results reveal that live comments are overall more emotionally intense than retrospective comments across all temporal periods and all event types. Findings support the emotional amplification hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence for shared attention theory in explaining the amplification effect. These findings have important implications for live streaming platforms to optimize resources for content moderation and to improve psychological well-being for content moderators. ",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. This skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world – i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. For example, Kay et al. [46] showed that although 28% of CEOs in US are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for “CEO” in Google Image Search are women. Similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. Most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. These labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges, and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. As observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people [16].\r\nWe develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. It accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this “diversity score” into the final selection process. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known MMR [14] algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy.\r\nWe evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 Google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known CelebA dataset [55] containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as “smiling” or “glasses”. Both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current Google Image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. Further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. These empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.",

      "trackId": 11081,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "The wide adoption of Machine Learning (ML) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ML models. Some advocated the term \"machine teacher\" to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ML models. This \"teaching\" perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-AI interfaces. One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains minimal and opaque. A dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for AL algorithms. In this work, we begin considering AI explanations as a core element of the human-AI interface for teaching machines. When a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. When a ML model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. When the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. Toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (XAL), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable AI (XAI) into an AL setting. We conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with XAL, to that of traditional AL and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). Our study shows benefits of AI explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. Our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to AI explanations, including task knowledge, AI experience and Need for Cognition. By reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for XAL, and more broadly, machine teaching through AI explanations.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring effective public understanding of algorithmic decisions that are powered by machine learning techniques has become an urgent task with the increasing deployment of AI systems into our society. In this work, we present a concrete step toward this goal by redesigning confusion matrices for binary classification to support non-experts in understanding the performance of machine learning models. Through interviews (n=7) and a survey (n=102), we mapped out two major sets of challenges lay people have in understanding standard confusion matrices: the general terminologies and the matrix design. We further identified three sub-challenges regarding the matrix design, namely, confusion about the direction of reading the data, layered relations and quantities involved. We then conducted an online experiment with 483 participants to evaluate how effective a series of alternative representations target each of those challenges in the context of an algorithm for making recidivism predictions. We developed three levels of questions to evaluate users' objective understanding. We assessed the effectiveness of our alternatives for accuracy in answering those questions, completion time, and subjective understanding. Our results suggest that (1) only by contextualizing terminologies can we significantly improve users' performance and (2) flow charts, which help point out the direction of reading the data, were most useful in improving objective understanding. Our findings set the stage for developing more intuitive and generally understandable representations of the performance of machine learning models. ",

      "abstract": "While crowd workers typically complete a variety of tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, there is no widely accepted method to successfully match workers to different types of tasks. Researchers have considered using worker demographics, behavioural traces, and prior task completion records to optimise task assignment. However, optimum task assignment remains a challenging research problem due to limitations of proposed approaches, which in turn can have a significant impact on the future of crowdsourcing. We present CrowdCog, an online dynamic system that performs both task assignment and task recommendations, by relying on fast-paced online cognitive tests to estimate worker performance across a variety of tasks. Our work extends prior work that highlights the effect of workers' cognitive ability on crowdsourcing task performance. Our study, deployed on Amazon Mechanical Turk, involved 574 workers and 983 HITs that span across four typical crowd tasks (Classification, Counting, Transcription, and Sentiment Analysis). Our results show that both our assignment method and recommendation method result in a significant performance increase (5% to 20%) as compared to a generic or random task assignment. Our findings pave the way for the use of quick cognitive tests to provide robust recommendations and assignments to crowd workers.",

The focus on `personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. To dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in Bangalore, India. In this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. We then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health.",

Prior to implementation, forward looking formative analyses can identify systems and policy designs to promote equitable benefit. We investigate this potential through an analysis of stakeholders to a potential drone implementation on a small commercial farm in Rwanda. Translating stakeholders' imaginaries within a post-colonial frame, we identify hopes and concerns related to agency and influenced by global and local systems of power. The findings highlight constraints that recommend system designs promoting local agency and control and policies designed to balance local data management against potentially `extractive' multinational data transfer processes.",

      "abstract": "Social comparison is a common focus in discussions of online social media use and differences in its frequency, causes, and outcomes may arise from country or cultural differences. To understand how these differences play a role in experiences of social comparison on Facebook, a survey of 37,729 people across 18 countries was paired with respondents' activity on Facebook. The findings were augmented with 39 in-person interviews in three countries. Social comparison frequency was more strongly predicted by country than by age, gender, and Facebook activity combined, indicating the importance of taking country into account when considering social comparison. Women's and men's experiences differed greatly between countries. Exposure to high feedback counts on friends' posts was associated with more frequent social comparison, but only in some countries. These findings suggest that design interventions that account for country differences may be more effective at reducing the negative outcomes of social comparison.",

In this paper, we investigate how office interior layouts influence the way we socially experience office buildings. We extend the previous work that examined static social formations of office workers by looking at their dynamic movements during informal desk visiting interactions. With a month of video data collected in the office, we implemented a vision-based analysis system that enables us to examine how people occupy space in social contexts in relation to desk configurations. The results showed that both social territoriality and approach path highlight social comfort in human-building interactions, which are different from efficiency or path optimization. From these findings, we propose the concepts of socio-spatial comfort: social buffers, privacy buffers, and varying proxemics to inform a user-centered way of designing human building interactions and architecture.",

In most schools, a significant amount time in the curriculum is devoted to phonics. However, it is a difficult skill which takes a long time to master. To address this, our research begins to explore how a multisensory toolkit could aid phonics learning and support engagement in the process. In this exploratory study, we use variants of the 'bouba/kiki' stimuli, which have been shown to have pre-existing shape, colour and scent mappings, and explore how they could be applied to phonics learning. We presented a first prototype to four children in order to gain initial insights of their experiences of using multisensory tangible models for phonics learning, as well as the types of sensory associations and interactions that could be further explored.",

      "abstract": "In-person user studies show that designers draw inspiration by looking at their peers' work while sketching. To recreate this behavior in a virtual environment, we developed Sketchy, a web-based drawing application that allows users to create sketches in virtual rooms and use the ``Peek'' functionality to gain ideas from their peers' sketches in real-time. To assess if ``Peek'' supports individual creativity through finding inspiration, students from a Human-Computer Interaction class sketched UI design tasks in two studies. The first study compared creativity measures with and without Peek between two groups of students, where self-reports reveal Peek increases satisfaction with their final sketch and better supports individual creativity. The second study took place in a large classroom, where 90 students, all with Peek enabled, completed different design tasks. Peeking led students to report an intention to change their sketch 17% of the time in Study 1 and 18% of the time in Study 2. Results show that student designers were influenced by sketches that seem closer to completion, contain more details, and are carefully drawn. Also, sketches created by students with more sketching and design experience influence less experienced student designers. This work explores directions for how to incorporate digital peeking to support individual creativity within a student designer's classroom experience to create more satisfactory final sketches.",

We study users of CaringBridge.org, an online health community for communicating about health journeys, using survival analysis methods to quantify the impact of engagement on retention. \r\nFirst, we explicitly compare the impact of non-text ``likes'' to text comments, surprisingly finding that likes exceed comments in their impact on retention for some users.\r\nSecond, we compare less active and more active users in their response to visitor engagement, finding that more active users are less affected by short-term visitor engagement.\r\nWe discuss the implications of our findings for the design of OHCs and for future work on visitor engagement.",

      "abstract": "Interruption dissemination in proactive systems remains a challenge for efficient human–machine collaboration, especially in real-time distributed collaborative environments. In this paper a real-time interruption management system (IMS) is proposed that leverages speech information, the most commonly used and available means of communication within collaborative distributed environments.  The key aspect of this paper includes a proposed real-time IMS system that leverages lexical affirmation cues to infer the end of a task or task boundary as a candidate interruption time.  The performance results show the proposed real-time lexical Affirmation Cues based Interruption Management System (ACE-IMS) outperforms the current baseline real-time IMS system within the existing literature. ACE-IMS has the potential of reducing disruptive interruptions without incurring excessive missed opportunities to disseminate interruptions by utilizing only the most frequently used mode of human communication: voice. Thereby, providing a promising new baseline to further the system development of real-time interruption management systems within the ever-growing distributed collaborative domain.   ",

This study explores differences in the discourse patterns of two popular online programming communities (Stack Overflow and r/Askprogramming) to provide preliminary insights into the type of learning practices these collectives support and scaffold. A three-step content analysis framework that investigates a sample of 8639 and 6126 contributions from Stack Overflow and r/Askprogramming respectively is presented. Preliminary results indicate that differences emerge in the scope of topics and the nature of responses the community provides. While Stack Overflow is more task-specific, r/Askprogramming supports a greater sense of bonding and camaraderie among community members in addition to task-specific discussions. These results provide insights into the type of practices these communities support, which can be essential in considering how online communities that support learning activities should be designed.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Despite many available social technologies for connecting at a distance, we don’t always find opportunities to actively engage with friends and loved ones, even though this kind of interaction is associated with reduced loneliness and increased social closeness. To meet our need for active engagement and to fit desired interactions into our busy lives, our work explores the design of Opportunistic Collective Experiences (OCEs), or social experiences powered by computer programs that proactively surface opportune moments as they arise for engaging in shared experiences and interdependent activities across distributed contexts. These programs identify the opportune situations as they arise in people’s physical contexts and structure links between seemingly independent situations in order to support active engagement in shared experiences and interdependent activities. To prototype these social experiences, we built Cerebro, which consists of a mobile app for users to interact when opportunities and situations align, a programming API for social experience designers to implement OCEs, and an execution engine for coordinating interactions. Through a 20 day deployment study tested with groups of geographically-distributed college alumni (N=28), we found that OCEs lower the barriers for interacting at a distance; enable more personal, shared experiences; and increase feelings of being a part of a group. We contribute to CSCW (1) a novel interaction that supports at-distance, actively engaging social interactions through shared experiences and activities without the need for initiating or preplanning; and (2) the design of systems to implement and execute these kinds of interactions.

      "abstract": "This study performs an initial exploration of cultural differences in social media disclosure behaviors. We focus on what U.S. and India users disclose about interpersonal relationships on Twitter, a popular social networking platform that has gained enormous traction outside the U.S. We developed a taxonomy of words representing interpersonal relationships and then collected all tweets containing these words (~4.5 million tweets) uploaded from India and the U.S. over a one-month period of time. We found that Indian tweets about others tend to be statistically significantly more positive and uncover differences in how they tweet about various relationships (family, friends, others) in comparison to U.S. users. Drawing on theories of collectivism and individualism, we discuss how different cultural attitudes may explain these behaviors. We present implications for research and for designing to support cultural norms.",

      "abstract": "While domestic abuse is an all too common experience for women worldwide, how people experience the abuse and their resources to deal with the abuse differ. In this qualitative, interview-based study, we examine Saudi women's domestic safety concerns. Based on non-Western Islamic feminist views of agency, we identify three key practices, focused on how women resist or deal with their domestic violence. For each practice, we highlight how interwoven cultural, religious, and political contexts impact Saudi women's ability to recognize and deal with domestic abuse, and attend to technology's role in enabling or hindering women's agency. These practices include: 1) recognizing abuse, where women identify abusive situations, 2) managing abuse, where women find ways to cope with ongoing or anticipated abuse within their constraints and resources, and 3) seeking non-abusive futures, where women decide how to mitigate the abuse or leave their abuser. Given domestic violence's complicated nature, we highlight several key design recommendations based on women's values.",

      "abstract": "Mobile games, except those location-based, augmented reality ones such as Pokémon Go, are designed to be placeless, so that mobile device owners could play anytime anywhere. Does such design erase the sense of place in mobile gaming? To investigate the spatiality of mobile gaming, we conducted an ethnographic study of mobile gaming in a Chinese university. We found mobile gaming as a form of collocated interaction, where participants collectively created meanings around distinctive places on the campus including dormitory, classroom, and laboratory, and engaged in collaborative play. Their mobile collocated gaming was shaped by the local social, organizational, and cultural contexts of places. The spatiality of mobile collocated gaming entails both learning and appropriation of the norms and expectations of places and creation of new meanings to negotiate tensions between mobile gaming and places. We further discuss the spatiality of collocated mobile gaming and broader social and cultural conditions.",

      "abstract": "Within online communities, social norms that both set expectations for and regulate behavior can be vital to the overall welfare of the community--particularly in the context of the privacy and safety of its members. For communities where the cost of regulatory failure can be high, it is important to understand both the conditions under which norms might be effective, and when they might fail. As a case study, we consider transformative fandom, a creative community dedicated to reimagining existing media in often subversive ways. In part due to the marginalized status of many members, there are strong, longstanding norms to protect the community. Through an interview study with 25 fandom participants, we investigate social norms that have been largely effective over time at maintaining member privacy and safety, but also break down under certain circumstances. Catalysts for these breakdowns include tensions between sub-communities and an increasing presence of outsiders, though most prominently, we identify a disconnect between the norms the community needs to support and the design of the platforms they occupy.",

To create large datasets necessary for these challenges, researchers typically employ a shared crowdsourcing task design for image captioning. This paper discusses findings from our thematic analysis of 1,064 comments left by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers using this task design to create captions for images taken by people who are blind. Workers discussed difficulties in understanding how to complete this task, provided suggestions of how to improve the task, gave explanations or clarifications about their work, and described why they found this particular task rewarding or interesting. Our analysis provides insights both into this particular genre of task as well as broader considerations for how to employ crowdsourcing to generate large datasets for developing AI-based systems.",

      "abstract": "Online communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft teams have become increasingly crucial for a digitized workplace to improve business efficiency and growth. However, these chat platforms can overwhelm the users with unstructured long streams of back and forth discussions scattered in various places. Thus, discussions become challenging to follow, leading to an increased likelihood of missing valuable information. Moreover, with the unsatisfying keyword-based chat search, users spend a significant amount of time to read, digest, and recall information from the conversations at the cost of productivity. In this paper, we present Vertext, an end-to-end AI system that ingests user conversations and automatically extracts information such as announcements, task assignments, and conversation summary. Moreover, Vertext gives a unique search experience to the users by providing search results along with their context, with an improved performance enabled by semantic search. For the ease of user interaction, all the information is consolidated on a single dashboard provided by Vertext.",

      "abstract": "  This paper addresses challenges in conceptualizing privacy posed by algorithmic systems that can infer sensitive information from seemingly innocuous data. This type of privacy is of imminent concern due to the rapid adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in virtually every industry. In this paper, we suggest informational friction, a concept from Floridi's ethics of information (Floridi 2013), as a valuable conceptual lens for studying algorithmic aspects of privacy. Informational friction describes the amount of work required for one agent to access or alter the information of another. By focusing on amount of work, rather than the type of information or manner in which it is collected, informational friction can help to explain why automated analyses should raise privacy concerns independently of, and in addition to, those associated with data collection. As a demonstration, this paper analyze law enforcement use of facial recognition, and Facebook's targeted advertising model using informational friction and demonstrate risks inherent to these systems which are not completely identified in another popular framework, Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity (Nissenbaum 2004). The paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications, both for privacy research and for privacy regulation.",

      "abstract": "While mobile instant messaging (MIM) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. We demonstrate MyButler, an Android app prototype that instantiates two design concepts for MIM---private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications---that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. Private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. Sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary mobile devices constantly interrupt people with notifications in various and changing physical environments, each with its own different social settings. To understand how users perceive disturbance to their social environment, we analyze the results of a 3-week user study with 50 participants. Using a mixture of experience sampling and log analysis, we show that perceptions of disturbance are influenced by the location, the activity carried out, the social environment, the norms that govern interaction in that location, the activity of the user on the device, and perceptions of that activity. In contrast to existing theories, we show that norms, such as whether the place is considered private or public, are more powerful than other factors. We conclude the paper by suggesting a new theoretical understanding that ties places and social contexts to mobile computing experience. \r\n",

While it is possible to iterate conversation design with existing chatbot prototyping tools, challenges remain such as recruiting participants and collecting structured feedback on specific conversational components, hindering rapid iterations, and making informed design decisions. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoChat, a crowd-powered design tool built to support the iterative process of conversation design for a chatbot. ProtoChat enables rapid testing with the crowd and guiding the crowd workers to provide granular feedback on specific points of conversation.",

      "abstract": "Creative workers frequently turn to online critique communities for feedback on their work. While past work has focused primarily on how to get better feedback from providers, less is known about the strategies feedback seekers use to engage providers and request feedback. We present two studies to explore the feedback exchange dynamics between feedback requesters and providers in the subreddit community, r/design\\_critiques. In Study 1, we interviewed 12 community members and found that while creators have strategies to request feedback, they expressed uncertainty about whether and how to include details about the design context, personal background, and specific feedback needs. In Study 2, through a mixed-method analysis, we identified how specific request strategies impact the quantity and quality of community feedback, and found several key, but undervalued strategies: signaling as a novice, critiquing one's own design, and providing design variants. These strategies led to better community response, but rarely get used. We offer design implications around how to leverage these insights to improve online feedback exchange systems.",

We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries—artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus.",

      "abstract": "Public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. In the US, applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. Online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. If incorrectly implemented, they may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. Unfortunately, errors are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. We introduce a method for auditing such tools. We generate test households that automatically populate screening questions. To detect errors, we compare the returned determinations to predictions from our formal eligibility guidelines model. Illustrated on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data, our method exposes major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. Our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process.",

      "abstract": "Over half of Syrian refugee households in Lebanon are food insecure with some reliant on an electronic voucher system for food aid. However, the interplay between the digitization of food aid within the socio-technical context of refugees and community collaborative practices is yet to be investigated. Through design engagements and interviews with a refugee community and shop owners we explore the experiences of a Syrian refugee community in Lebanon using the e-voucher system. The paper provides insights into (1) the socio-technical environment in which the e-voucher system is dispensing aid, (2) refugee collaborative coping practices, (3) the information and power asymmetries that result from the digitization of aid and (4) the interplay between the e-voucher system and the collaborative practices adopted by refugees to cope with their food insecurity. We highlight the need for: (1) expanding refugee digital capabilities to encompass understandings of aid technological systems and identifying trusted intermediaries and (2) for technologies to support in upholding humanitarian principles and mitigating power and information asymmetries. Lastly, we call for CSCW researchers and humanitarian innovators to consider how humanitarian technologies can enable refugee collaborative practices and adopt everyday security as a lens for designing aid technologies.",

      "abstract": "Storytelling which is a productive intimate parent-child interaction activity can promote children's emotional management, social competence, and cognitive ability. Joint media engagement (JME) provides digital interaction and becomes a convenient tool for storytelling. However, the interaction between users via JME can be unnatural and unintuitive because of the drawbacks due to the one-sided human-machine interface, continual attention, and tedious work in story planning for characters. To tackle the drawbacks, we propose a parallel interaction storytelling system that uses co-located story enactment experience and object-oriented characters. Our system enables users to enhance parallel interaction in a virtual collaboration environment for storytelling. They can interactively construct stories and manipulate characters in an intuitive manner. An initial testing of the system shows a popular adaptation for parents and their children.",

      "abstract": "For modern data analytics, practices from software development are increasingly necessary to manage data, but they must be incorporated alongside other statistical and scientific skills. Therefore, we ask: how does a community recontextualize software development through the unique pressures of their work? To answer this, we explore the analytic community around baseball, or sabermetrics. To discover software development's place in the search for robust statistical insight in sports, we interview 10 participants in the sabermetric community and survey over 120 more data analysts, both in baseball and not. We explore how their work lives at the intersection of science and entertainment, and as a consequence, baseball data serves as an accessible yet deep subject to practice analytic skills. Software development exists within an iterative research process that cycles between defining rigorous statistical methods and preserving the flexibility to chase interesting problems. In this question-driven process, members of the community inhabit several overlapping roles of intentional work, in which software development can become the priority to support research and statistical infrastructure, and we discuss the way that the community can foster the balance of these skills.",

      "abstract": " YouTube is one of the most popular and largest sources of videos, that hosts many video tutorials which aim to teach concepts of various programming languages. Most of these tutorials include code snippets that are displayed and written by the tutor during the video. However, it is important that the learners using these programming tutorials have a hands-on experience while learning various programming concepts. Providing a code editor along with the video tutorial could help learners get a better learning experience, as they have a scope to learn by practice. Existing solutions of accompanying video tutorials with code editors are either pre-programmed or require a separate web portal. We are not aware of any solutions in the literature that aim to support Youtube video tutorials. Hence, we present YTCoder in this paper that aims to improve the learning experience by integrating videos related to various programming languages with the development environments of the respective programming languages. It also aims to help reduce some of the repetitive and monotonous elements of programming, which might turn away newcomers by allowing the extraction of code when required. Demonstration of YTCoder can be found here at : https://youtu.be/iONtO7cuQwo",

      "abstract": "Human-AI interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of an AI-driven word association game. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and more use positive words to describe their partner's attributes. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication. ",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": " During outbreaks of pandemics such as Covid-19, understanding the emotional state of citizens of a country could be of interest to various organizations to carry out tasks and to take necessary measures. Twitter and other social media platforms have been bridging the gap between the citizens and government in various countries and are of more prominence in India. Analysing real time posts on twitter in India during Covid-19, could help in identifying the mood of the nation. However, most of the existing studies related to Covid-19, on twitter and other social media platforms are performed on data posted during a specific interval. We are not aware of any research that identifies emotional state of India on a daily basis. Hence, we present a web portal that aims to display mood of India during Covid-19, based on real time twitter data. This portal also enables users to select date range, specific date and state in India to display mood of people belonging to the specified region, on the specified date or during the specified date range. Also, the number of Covid-19 cases and mood of people in specific cities and states on specific dates is visualized on the country map. As of June 25 2020, the web portal has about 703618 tweets, and each of these tweets are classified into seven categories that include six basic emotions and a neutral category. A list of Trigger Events are also specified, to allow users to view the mood of India on specific events happening in the country during Covid-19. \r\nMood of India During Covid-19 portal can be accessed from https://moodofindia.herokuapp.com/ and demonstration video can be found at https://youtu.be/2b0k_p1Hq9A.",

      "abstract": "Depression is common but under-treated in patients with cancer, despite being a major modifiable contributor to morbidity and early mortality. Integrating psychosocial care into cancer services through the team-based Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) model has been proven to be effective in improving patient outcomes in cancer centers. However, there is currently a gap in understanding the challenges that patients and their care team encounter in managing co-morbid cancer and depression in integrated psycho-oncology care settings. Our formative study examines the challenges and needs of CoCM in cancer settings with perspectives from patients, care managers, oncologists, psychiatrists, and administrators, with a focus on technology opportunities to support CoCM. We find that: (1) patients with co-morbid cancer and depression struggle to navigate between their cancer and psychosocial care journeys, and (2) conceptualizing co-morbidities as separate and independent care journeys is insufficient for characterizing this complex care context. We then propose the parallel journeys framework as a conceptual design framework for characterizing challenges that patients and their care team encounter when cancer and psychosocial care journeys interact. We use the challenges discovered through the lens of this framework to highlight and prioritize technology design opportunities for supporting whole-person care for patients with co-morbid cancer and depression.",

Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants’ personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants’ accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who \"gets it\" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups.",

      "abstract": "Foster teens are some of the most vulnerable youth who are subject to serious online risks, such as sex trafficking. My 2017 IDC literature review paper highlighted the need to develop effective sociotechnical interventions to empower foster youth against becoming victims of sexual predation. To fill this gap, my dissertation is comprised of three studies that will investigate: 1) how foster parents mediate their teens’ technology use in the home, 2) how foster youth experience sexual risks online, and 3) working with foster youth to co-design effective socio-technical interventions that can protect them from these online risks. My goal for this research is to understand, design, and develop sociotechnical systems that can help promote more teen-centric approaches to online safety and reduce the digital inequalities experienced by teens in foster care.

Using an autoethnographic approach, we discuss our community-based design process, which was documented with memos, online meetings and text conversations, sketches, and other data sources. We illustrate how we articulated our values as a group: deciding our programming framework (including a Statement of Principles), elaborating our “Experience Goals” (the feelings we wanted our design to elicit), and determining the features we wanted to implement in our app. We conclude with a reflection on the benefits and challenges of conducting community-based design research through an open-source organizational model.",

      "abstract": "In today’s Anthropocene era, sustainability challenges, such as climate extremes, threaten the livelihood of vulnerable communities and social equity across the planet. To mitigate the risks of sustainability threats, computational methods, artistic practices, and data-and-theory driven scientific models play a critical role. However, these artifacts alone fail to reach a broader audience and translate into public dialogue for participatory collective action. In this paper, we present Beyond Boundaries, a renaissance that re-envisions the relationship between ecological arts and computational thinking to contextualize threats to sustainability at the individual, regional and global scales. Through the lens of earth remote sensing satellite time series, half a decade of ecological arts, and a month-long public exhibition, we provide a framework to establish the symbiotic relationship between artistic and scientific practices. Beyond Boundaries sheds new light on how the symbiotic relationship can inspire scientific inquiry, artistic imaginations, and civic engagement for sustainability.    ",

      "abstract": "To prevent harmful AI behavior, people need to specify constraints that forbid undesirable actions.  Unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations.  In this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of humans to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to AI systems.  We first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of AI behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants seem to naturally adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. Building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new  filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection.  Next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge.  We test our approaches on a real-world AI problem in the domain of  education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency.  We also  demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world AI problems (e.g. in social networks).",

      "abstract": "My research area lies at the intersection of stigma, technology, and HCI research methods. In the case of HIV, design of technology has focused on medication adherence and treatment management and less on exploring how people living with HIV can cope with HIV-related stigma more directly via the use of technology. Additionally, HCI research on HIV has relied on face-to-face studies. My dissertation work thus focuses on two aspects: (1) HCI research conducted remotely via the Internet; and (2) the design of technology that could help individuals cope with HIV-related stigma. My prior work has already explored the first aspect. At the moment, I am planning a study that would involve remote asynchronous and synchronous co-design workshops. There are several contributions of my dissertation work. First, it  provides insights, lessons, and best practices to conduct HCI research with a stigmatized population remotely. Second, it explores the use of current technology to cope with public HIV-related stigma; and, third, it explores the speculative design of technology that could help people cope with HIV-related stigma more directly.",

      "abstract": "For individuals with mental illness, social media platforms are considered spaces for sharing and connection. However, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. Different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. Through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. We use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. Above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. Practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as `normal' and valued, while rejecting others. At the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. We discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design. ",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Activities of people, recorded as digital traces via digital devices or online environments, offer increasingly comprehensive pictures of both individual and group-level behavior, potentially allowing inferences within and outside the platforms recording these traces. These digital traces are often in the form of textual units such as tweets or reddit posts or comments. Compared to survey responses, which are solicited, these social media posts are the organic, unsolicited thoughts of people on a variety of topics, and the language in these posts are a key to their attitudes, beliefs and values. Notwithstanding the many promises of digital traces, recent studies have begun to discuss the errors that can occur when digital traces are used to learn about humans and social phenomena. In this thesis, I propose to first, diagnose and characterize issues in the measurement of people's attitudes at scale, and second, mitigate these errors through theory-driven solutions. To critically study and record errors, biases, and issues in using digital traces for measuring human behavior, we propose a systematic framework, named ‘Total Error Framework for Digital Traces’ (TED). TED is inspired by and adapted from the Total Survey Error Framework, developed and employed in survey methodology to assess the validity and reliability of survey-based studies. To mitigate errors unearthed by looking at Computational Social Science through TED, we suggest and apply several domain specific solutions, such as using linguistic theories to understand people's unexpressed attitudes. This thesis contributes in improving the reliability and validity of attitude measurement from digital traces.",

      "abstract": "Many parents of young children find it challenging to deal with their children's eating problems, and parent--child mealtime interaction is fundamental in forming children's healthy eating habits. In this paper, we present the results of a three-week study through which we deployed a mealtime assistant application, MAMAS, for monitoring parent--child mealtime conversation and food intake with 15 parent--child pairs. Our findings indicate that the use of MAMAS helped 1) increase children's autonomy during mealtime, 2) enhance parents' self-awareness of their words and behaviors, 3) promote the parent--child relationship, and 4) positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. The  study also revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. Based on the findings, we discuss how a mealtime assistant application can be better designed for parents and children with challenging eating behaviors.",

My prior work highlighted that dissatisfaction with data monetization is technology users’ top motivation for stopping or changing use of a technology. Building upon this study and other scholarly and legislative efforts, my dissertation work will focus on addressing the lack of transparency about data’s monetary value to both technology users and policymakers. I will assess the economic value of users’ data and develop tools to make this value transparent, with the goal of supporting collective action and policymaking. Additionally, I expect my work to provide design recommendations for technologies that profit from user data to communicate data’s monetary value openly. Overall, I see my work as a step toward a more equitable data economy.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.",

However, as there can be many participants in a single chat conversation, it may be difficult for members of a group to keep up and stay grounded during the long stream of conversation generated by the participants. We conducted a need-finding study where we asked participants to work on various collaborative tasks in real-time chat software to learn about issues and behavioral patterns in a group chat conversation at a scale of five to ten people. Study participants also filled out a reflection survey after the study, describing challenges they faced while participating in a group chat during the study and in general group chat situation. In our analysis of chat logs, we discuss the challenges in keeping up with messages, wasting effort due to a lack of contemporality, and how challenges vary with the nature of collaborative tasks. We also suggested a few design interventions that can address these challenges in chat software through spatial and temporal design changes, facilitating fluent communication in a group chat. We leave their implementation to a future project. ",

      "trackId": 11079,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality and autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only estimating object location and orientation, but also unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). One way to combat this problem in a scalable way is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ``see'' depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach is able to generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding multiple different objects that share a spatial relationship. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that the proposed method can reduce errors in a target object's 3D location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only 35% as much human time. Our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks.",

To understand the opportunities and challenges that fusing social networking platforms, personal fabrication equipment, and e-commerce have afforded these homepreneurs, an online survey and follow-up interviews were conducted with crafters who use hobbyist cutting plotters to personalize and sell goods online. The findings uncovered an emerging group of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, who use these technologies for supplemental income for their families and highlighted the emotional and opportunistic benefits that personalized, at-home manufacturing affords. They also uncovered the workflows and lifestyle implications of using these technologies to run home-based businesses, the multi-faceted usage and dependence these homepreneurs have on online social platforms such as Facebook, the complex software toolchains that these homepreneurs use, and the commonplace practice of appropriating designs from others that occurs in this community.

      "abstract": "Race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures—from the passport to social media. Facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "The methods in which we study the online experiences of adolescents should be evidence-based and informed by youth. This is especially true when studying sensitive topics, such as the online risk behaviors of minors. To do this, we directly engaged 20 adolescents (ages 12-18) in the co-design of two different research methodologies (i.e., diary studies and analyzing social media trace data) for conducting adolescent online safety research. We also interviewed 13 of their parents to understand their perspectives. Overall, teens wanted to share their personal experiences and benefit society, while parents wanted researchers to tackle a topic that they felt was a prevalent problem for teens. Yet, they both had significant concerns regarding data privacy of the sensitive disclosures made by teens during such studies, in particular, teens’ fear of getting in trouble. Participants emphasized the importance of developing a trusting relationship with the researcher to overcome these concerns. Participants also saw the potential for using the research study as a tool for risk-reporting and mitigation, where researchers could act as liaisons between the teens and other parties (e.g., counselors, law enforcement, parents) to share pertinent risk details and facilitate resources or even help teens directly by giving them strategies for mitigating online risks they encountered during the study. Our research delves into important ethical considerations for conducting risk-focused research with adolescents and uncovers the critical need for designing risk-based research for youth protection. We provide researchers with heuristic guidelines for conducting ethical research with vulnerable populations (i.e., adolescents) and keeping participants safe while doing so.",

My proposed dissertation seeks to understand ML engineers’ ethical sensitivity– their propensity to notice, analyze, and act on socially impactful aspects of their work-—while curating training data and describe the effects of context documents and ethical guides as practice-based ethics interventions in this early stage of ML development. It asks how ML engineers recognize,particularize, and judge ethical questions while exploring new training data; introduces Ethical Sensitivity to the study of social computing; and will describe how Datasheets intervene in recognition and particularization; and will develop a document that can help engineers move from particularization to judgment. It will accomplish these goals using a think aloud experiment with engineers working with unfamiliar training data (with or without a Datasheet), a Value Sensitive Design study that aims to fit an ethical mitigation guide to engineers’ work practices, and a systematic review of ethical sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "There is a risk that modern practices of information communication and visualization in human-computer interaction can sideline communities due to their prioritization of scientific rationality. Such ideological hegemony can complicate interactions with data and computers, especially for low-literate communities in the global south. Through a six-month long ethnographic study with Nakshi-Katha makers, Hindu Idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information mediated decision making. We find that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting and communicating information often make use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers' cultural practices and the physical location. Further, we identify how medium has significant influence in meaning-making. Often these strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. In this paper, we discuss how this rural tradition differs from the modern information communication practices, discussing how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information can be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural Bangladesh and similar communities.",

In particular, we conducted semi-structured interview with 15 participants in the USA to gain insights into their perceived benefits and concerns about using digital pill, preferences to share information with others, and their preferred modes of learning about the privacy notice before using digital medicine.

      "abstract": "Traditionally, urban accessibility is defined as the ease of reaching destinations. Studies on urban accessibility for pedestrians with mobility disabilities (e.g., wheelchair users) have primarily focused on understanding the challenges that the built environment imposes and how they overcome them. In this paper, we move beyond physical barriers and focus on socio-political challenges in the civic ecosystem that impedes accessible infrastructure development. Using a multi-stakeholder approach, we interviewed five primary stakeholder groups (N=25): (1) people with mobility disabilities, (2) caregivers, (3) accessibility advocates, (4) department officials, and (5) policymakers. We discussed their current accessibility assessment and decision-making practices. We identified the key needs and desires of each group, how they differed, and how they interacted with each other in the civic ecosystem to bring about change. We found that people, politics, and money were intrinsically tied to underfunded accessibility improvement projects—without continued support from the public and the political leadership, existing funding may also disappear. Using the insights from these interviews, we explore how may technology enhance our stakeholders’ decision-making processes and facilitate accessible infrastructure development.",

      "abstract": "Search engines are the primary gateways of information. Yet, they do not take into account the credibility of search results. There is a growing concern that YouTube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. In this study, we audit YouTube to verify those claims. Our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. After shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits: Search- and Watch-misinformative audits. Our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56K videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. Our videos correspond to three major YouTube components: search results, Up-Next, and Top 5 recommendations. We find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. On the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. Further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the Top 5 and Up-Next recommendations for all topics, except vaccines controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations. In conclusion, YouTube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic eye diseases, especially Diabetic Retinopathy, are the leading cause of vision loss worldwide and can be prevented by early diagnosis through annual retinal screening. Various socio-cultural factors, such as cost, healthcare disparities, cultural limitations, etc. are the foremost barriers against regular screening in minority communities. Retinal-screenings arranged in community settings with native-speaking staffs can facilitate regular check-ups and overcome language barriers of underprivileged communities compared to conventional clinical settings. As part of our study, we surveyed 400 participants to assess the acceptance of community-based screening methods among community participants. In addition to very positive responses about this screening approach's diverse perspectives, we found that having native-speaking staff at screening events can help overcome language barriers. Moreover, integrating multilingual support in the electronic health record software to assist the native-speaking staff is a significant factor in designing such systems.  ",

      "abstract": "Open Source Software (OSS) development is a collaborative endeavor where expert developers, who are spread around the globe create software solutions. Given this characteristic, OSS communities have been studied as technical communities, where stakeholders join and evolve in their careers based on their (often voluntary) code contributions to the project. However, the OSS landscape is now changing with more people and companies getting involved in OSS. This means that projects now need people in non-technical roles and activities to keep the project sustainable and evolving. In this paper, we focus on understanding the roles and activities that are part of the current OSS landscape and the different career pathways in OSS. By conducting and analyzing 17 interviews with OSS contributors who are well known in the community, we provide empirical evidence of the existence and importance of community-centric roles (e.g advocate, license manager, community founder) in addition to the well-known project-centric ones (e.g maintainer, core member). However, the community-centric roles typically remain hidden, since these roles may not leave traces in software repositories typically analyzed by researchers. We found that people can build a career in OSS through different roles and activities, with different backgrounds, including those not related to software development. Further, people’s career pathways are fluid, moving between project and community-centric roles. Our work highlights that communities and researchers need to take action to acknowledge the importance of these varied roles, making these roles visible and well-recognized, which can ultimately help attract and retain more people in the OSS projects.",

Across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about reproducibility. We present findings from a qualitative study of a NSF--funded two-week workshop developed to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive computing, with a focus on reproducible science. Our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse.",

      "abstract": "Conflicts between communities in social-networking sites can degrade quality of communication and discourage participation, so understanding conflict dynamics can aid community management. However, studying inter-community conflict is challenging due to the open-ended nature of communication between communities. We study r/place, a 3-day pseudo-experiment on Reddit that provides an opportunity to observe inter-community conflict in a zero-sum environment. We quantify conflicts on r/place, identifying users and communities involved. We find that conflicts on r/place involve multiple communities on both the “winning” and “losing” side, and that communities get involved in conflicts due to geographic proximity on the canvas and due to existing political or cultural conflicts. Examining conflict winners reveals that total number of users is more important than highly-active users. Our results have implications for mitigating negative inter-community conflict on social-networking sites.",

      "abstract": "The electronic medical record (EMR) systems face many challenges in supporting chronic disease treatment,especially in medical information summary. Many solutions have recently been proposed for hospitals in developed countries. However, these solutions may be not suitable for the hospitals in developing countries because their workflow and patterns may be quite different due to their resource limitations, especially in shortage of physicians. Investigating the information summary alternatives in treating chronic diseases in such hospitals can shed light on EMR system design, especially on that for developing countries. We study one of the best pediatric hospitals in China. It suffers from a severe shortage of physicians. We introduce its information summary alternative, Follow-up Sheet. In particular, we study how and why pediatricians treat chronic diseases with the sheet. Our work unveils the intense work patterns and their corresponding information requirements of hospitals in China. We also demonstrate the characteristics of the Follow-up Sheet and accordingly discuss how EMR systems can be optimized.",

We conducted an observation and interview study with older adults who volunteer in a water monitoring group to investigate the role of sustained volunteering participation on healthy aging. Our findings suggest sustained engagement is influenced by role choice and role change over time. We found that supporting older adults as they age through these two factors allowed them to actively contribute to their health and well-being for many years. We suggest taking participation roles into consideration when designing technologies that promote older adult’s health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "There is a long-standing interest in CSCW on distributed instruction - both in how it differs from co-located instruction as well as the design of tools to reduce any deficiencies. In this study, we leveraged the unique environment of laparoscopic surgery to compare the efficacy and mechanism of instruction in a co-located and distributed condition. By implementing the same instructional technology in both conditions, we are able to evaluate the effect of distance on instruction without the confounding variable of medium of instruction. Surprisingly, our findings reveal a higher perceived quality of instruction by trainees in the distributed condition. Further investigation suggests that in a distributed learning environment, trainees change their behavior to attend more to the provided instructions resulting in this higher perceived quality of instruction. Finally, we discuss our findings with regards to media compensation theory, and we provide both social and technical insights on how to better support a distributed instructional process.",

Using archived YouTube live video transcripts and associated live chat messages, we find evidence for emotional contagion in live streams: sentiment in live video oral transcripts and viewers’ text chat is associated with the sentiment in subsequent viewers’ comments. This relationship is stronger between viewers’ chat messages and the subsequent chat than between the oral messages in the video and the subsequent chat. However, in some types of live streams, negative sentiment in the live video is followed by less negative chat. We conclude with a discussion of future research and potential uses of the dataset. ",

      "abstract": "Nudges have proved to be positive tools to realise behavioural policy interventions and are increasingly adopted by governments to promote social welfare. Still, there is an open debate on the ethics of nudges, and the extent to which nudging can go beyond manipulation purposes and be successfully used for studying and promoting critical thinking and behaviour change in highly contested domains. We present a tool, Democratic Reflection, for nudging citizens’ democratic engagement with political election debates. Democratic Reflection is a moment-by-moment second screen interaction technology for capturing audience feedback to time-based stimuli like speeches, TV programs, or video replays. While viewing the stimuli, users select from a matrix of icons, each of which describes a reflective nudge and a reaction the respondent may be having at the current moment. Initial insights from the applications of this technology in the latest 2015, 2017 and 2019 UK elections, suggest that the reflective nudges enabled by Democratic Reflection can be used to promote active engagement with politics, and if used at scale may affect the willingness of people to be involved in political processes in the future.",

      "abstract": "The rise of the Maker movement has led to a growing number of developers who prototype and program embedded systems. When programming, these developers often rely on support from various resources—including other developers. However, other developers may not always be available to provide support in person, and existing technologies for online help, such as voice chat or Q\\&A forms, face the fundamental limitation of inspecting and manipulating developers' circuit boards. As a result, remote helpers can only provide suggestions or guidance, rather than contributing via physical changes made to the devices. And only end-user developers have the ability to carry out the planned tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate WireOn, a programming support research prototype that allows remote helpers to directly perform tasks on end-user developers' circuit board by teleoperating a robot arm. The helpers can control the robot arm via a web user interface to perform simple tasks such as pick-and-place the electronic components, visually inspect the physical artifacts in real time, and also review the code that the end-user sent over to them. The new system has the potential to enable more efficient remote collaboration on embedded system development. (https://youtu.be/uggyxHAlLDQ)",

      "abstract": "Urban residents often use public transit to travel throughout the city; yet find it difficult to learn about events in one’s neighborhood. Transit rides can also be isolating and routine, despite seeing the same people regularly. As a result, there are opportunities to connect with others on the same route. While digital technologies such as community systems, social media, and public displays have been studied to understand how people engage with each other in their community, little is known about the challenges people face when searching for local information while commuting. Our research explores how one form of technology, location-based games (LBGs), supports urban commuters in digital placemaking. We present a prototype of an LBG, City Explorer, that allows riders to maintain an awareness of location-specific events and to support the sharing of community information. City Explorer is designed for public transit riders in a metropolitan city to collaborate with other riders, supporting community awareness, and facilitating discussions related to places on their transit route.",

Through my doctoral research, I aim to create a privacy enhancing camera-based assistive system for people with visual impairments to address their privacy considerations. To inform designs for an effective, usable, and privacy-aware assistive system, I seek to gain an understanding of 1)~what privacy considerations PVIs have with camera based assistive technologies, and 2)~what factors should be considered to design privacy-aware assistive technologies.",

      "abstract": "Social conformity is a widespread social phenomenon, where individuals change their personal opinions and behaviour to agree with an opposing majority’s expectations. While conformity has been extensively researched in face-to-face groups, its dynamics in online groups is yet to be thoroughly understood. The literature notes both positive (e.g., sense of belonging) and negative (e.g., undue pressure) implications of conformity in online settings. However, it is unclear how to design for online group settings accounting for conformity influences to facilitate positive group interactions. Thus, this research has three main contributions. First, I aim to thoroughly investigate the effects of popular contextual and personal determinants of face-to-face conformity (e.g., majority size, task objectivity and self-confidence) in online settings. Second, I will explore determinants such as social presence and gender, which may manifest differently in online settings in comparison to face-to-face groups. Based on this knowledge, I then aim to present a set of empirically validated design recommendations to inform the design of healthy online communities, accounting for both positive and negative implications of social conformity.",

In addition to making IPOD publicly available, we also: (i) manually annotate each job title with its associated level of seniority, domain of work and location; and (ii) provide embedding for job titles and discuss various use cases.

      "abstract": "Scholars who study hiring and inequality often focus on low-skill, low-wage labor markets. As inequality is driven by both marginalization and privilege, my dissertation complements prior studies by examining the hiring process of large technology companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, and Facebook). Through a two-year mixed-methods study involving evaluators and applicants, my research illuminates whether and how social class background shapes evaluators’ assessments and applicants’ preparation and self-presentation strategies. In alignment with ongoing efforts to broaden participation in the technology industry, this study provides strategies for evaluators to enact inclusive hiring practices and ways for applicants to navigate the hiring process.",

      "abstract": "Software bots are applications that are integrated into human communication channels, serving as an interface between users and other tools. Due to their focus on task automation, bots have become particularly relevant for Open Source Software (OSS) projects hosted on GitHub. While bots are adopted to save developers' costs, time, and effort, the interaction of these bots can be disruptive to the community. My research goal is two-fold: (i) identify problems caused by bots that interact in pull requests, and (ii) help bot designers to enhance existing bots, thereby improving the partnership with contributors and maintainers. Toward this end, we are interviewing developers to understand what are the problems on the human-bot interaction and how they affect human collaboration. Afterwards, we will employ Design Fiction to capture the developers' vision of bots' capabilities, in order to define guidelines for the design of bots on social coding platforms, and derive requirements for a meta-bot to deal with the problems. This work contributes more broadly to the design and use of software bots to enhance developers' collaboration and interaction.",

This dissertation uses social media in concert with multimodal sensing focusing on situated communities. Before incorporating such assessments in practice, we need to account for confounds impacting behavior change. One such confound is “observer effect”, that individuals may self-alter their otherwise normal behavior because of the awareness of being “monitored”. My proposed work studies this problem on social media behavior. On a multisensor study of 750 participants, I intend to conduct a causal study of modeling behavior change during study participation. This work will provide valuable insights and guide recommendations for correcting biases due to observer effect. This dissertation bears implications for social computing systems and stakeholders to support wellbeing and crisis intervention efforts in situated communities.",

      "abstract": "Many companies are focusing on remote working since the Covid-19 pandemic. One difference between remote working environment and face-to-face setting is the absence of natural awareness, which promotes social interaction and helps coordination of work flow. To maintain the benefits of awareness in a remote working environment, it is important to first understand which information remote workers disclose and need for awareness. In this paper, we aim to investigate which information is disclosed and needed, and provide insights to mitigate the difference between the two. We conducted a case study with an actual workgroup of a university laboratory for a week. They disclosed and accessed each other’s status information while working remotely. Then, a semi-structured interview asked why certain information was disclosed or accessed. Our results provide understanding over information sharing between remote workers for awareness in a post-pandemic world.",

To understand how language-specific social communities conduct Q/A-based discussions on online forums, we need to study Quora platform. As the first step to that, we need a data collection API. We introduce quoras, a Python API for collecting data from Quora. The API relies on Selenium, which is an open-source cross platform web automation framework. The API operates by creating custom HTTPS requests to Quora and parsing responses from it. It has the ability to perform many types of advanced searches that are otherwise only available on the Quora website, and not through any other existing APIs. The quoras API is released under an open-source MIT license and available along with the full API reference on GitHub. The latest stable release is also available on Python Package Index (PyPI).",

      "abstract": "Despite the lack of inclusive participation from attendees and civic organizers struggle to capture their feedback in reports, local government continue to depend of traditional methods such as town halls for community consultation. We present CommunityClick, a community-sourcing system that uses modified iClickers to enable silent attendees' to provide real-time feedback and records meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback. These feedback are combined to generate an augmented meeting transcript and feedback-weighted summary, incorporated into an interactive tool for organizers to author reports. Our field deployment at a town hall and interviews with 8 organizers demonstrate CommunityClick's utility in improving inclusivity and authoring more comprehensive reports.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face difficulties creating and maintaining social connections with others, which has been shown to negatively affect their well-being. Some researchers have investigated whether social media use can lead to social benefits, but with mixed results. To better understand how social media use can be beneficial and what challenges it poses, we conducted an interview study with eight adults on the Autism Spectrum. We report on the perceived benefits and real challenges participants faced when trying to engage with others through social media. Often the benefits users hope for are overshadowed by negative ramifications and safety risks that accompany their social media use. We conclude with recommendations for designing social media for neurodiverse users.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 has been detrimental to small businesses like independent theaters that exist to engage with the public offline. Independent theaters across the US have temporarily closed their doors, leaving their function as vessels for the arts unfulfilled and their business solvency in question. As such, theaters have turned to various technologies to increase their virtual presence and to (re)connect with their communities online. We present an investigation into theaters’ strategies of 1) attracting existing patrons, 2) encouraging commitment, and 3) fostering contribution in an unforeseen public health crisis where face-to-face interactions are no longer possible. Our results suggest that emphasizing shared identity and relying on technologies to facilitate new forms of interactions that were not available offline are critical to the migration of offline community to online settings.",

However, these online spaces are not designed with the unique needs and knowledge of those practice in mind, and do not easily enable facilitators to use their specific tools to hold discussion. This poster is an early-stage exploration and evaluation of an online synchronous audio conversation platform, Keeper, designed and informed by these facilitation practices to aid facilitation online. In this paper, we define three initial goals of the platform informed by these facilitation practices and interviews with expert facilitators: 1) set the tone for facilitated, sharing discussion, 2) ease the practice and smoothness of these online conversations, and 3) improve social presence online. After an initial controlled study with 107 participants across 25 conversations, we observe that tone and ease of synchronous conversations could be improved with the introduction of this tool, and patterns that suggest strong social presence in the tool.

      "abstract": "Exposure to information sources of different types and modalities, such as social media, movies, and scholarly reports, and interactions with other communities and groups can change a person’s values as well as their knowledge and attitude towards various social phenomena. My doctoral research aims to analyze the effect of these various stimuli on people and groups by applying mixed-method approaches that include techniques from natural language processing, close reading, and machine learning. The research leverages different types of user-generated texts, i.e., social media and customer reviews, and professionally-generated texts, i.e., scholarly publications and organizational documents, to study (1) the impact of information that aims to advance social good for individuals and society, and (2) the impact of social and individual biases on people's language use. This work contributes to knowledge, theory and computational solutions relevant to the field of computational social science. The approaches and insights discussed can provide a better understanding of people's attitudes and judgments toward issues and events of general interest, which is necessary to develop solutions for minimizing biases, filter bubbles, and polarization while also improving the effectiveness of interpersonal and societal discourse.",

      "abstract": "The rise of biometric security changes how users make decisions about their privacy. As passwords give way to faces and fingerprints, the algorithmic nature of these processes creates new cognitive labor for users. When biometrics are used in spaces of algorithmic management, workers must negotiate tradeoffs between security, privacy, fairness, and their livelihood. A mixed-methods, human-centered research design paired with theory frameworks from algorithmic management, usable security, and algorithmic fairness illuminates how workers navigate facial recognition at the level of local practice. As AI/ML technologies for management and security become increasingly interwoven, the implications of this research are significant.",

We carried out contextual interviews with nine individuals who were involved in a wide range of making activities. Our findings showed that DIY processes were centered around improving our participants’ existing living conditions and were manifested through two main motivations: sustainable and economical living; and social and community wellbeing. We contribute to the CSCW research in two ways. First, we provide a nuanced view on DIY involving a group of economically struggling individuals that is not well aligned with the traditional narratives. Second, we highlight the societal and economic factors that influenced the specific types of DIY activities that helped improve their existing lives.",

      "abstract": "Primary and secondary education is a crucial stage to build a strong foundation before diving deep into specialised subjects in colleges and universities. To excel in the current education system, students are required to have a deep understanding of knowledge according to standardized curriculums and syllabus, and exam-related problem solving skills. In current school settings, this learning normally occurs in large classes of 30-40 students per class. Such a ``one size fits all'' approach may not be effective, as different students proceed on their learning in different ways and pace. To address this problem, we propose the Self-Evolving Adaptive Learning (SEAL) system for personalized education at scale. ",

We add to existing research of how digital forms of craft engage with the longstanding traditions and rituals of the craft by introducing a case about the craft patterns from central Anatolia, Turkey. We present a collective ritualistic practice, the dowry making, and the patterns used in dowry to understand the relationship between craft and the dowry pattern as a reflection of those practices. By imagining how the craft patterns and craft-making should transfer to a digital context, we aim to inform how technologies and craft can engage on a level that respects the cultural, traditional, and ritualistic components that comprise the context in which the craft practice is situated. We provide several reflection points on how to avoid being reductionist in applications of technology.  ",

The goal of this workshop is, therefore, to advance CSCW research by raising awareness for the ongoing challenges and open questions around civic technology by bridging the gap between researchers and practitioners from different regions. The workshop will be organized around three central topics: (1) discuss how the local context and infrastructure affect the design, implementation, adoption, and maintenance of civic technology; (2) identify key elements of the configuration of trust among government, citizenry, and local organizations and how these elements change depending on the sociopolitical context where community engagement takes place; (3) discover what methods and strategies are best suited for conducting research on civic technologies in different contexts. These core topics will be covered across sessions that will initiate in-depth discussions and, thereby, stimulate collaboration between the CSCW research community and practitioners of civic technologies from both Global North and South.",

Further, public scholarship can support ethical research as a way to (1) reconnect with participants after data collection; and (2) increase the societal benefit of the research. However, despite these benefits there are also challenges and risks associated with engaging in public scholarship, particularly for early career researchers and those who are marginalized. This workshop will bring together those who already engage or are interested in this practice to discuss how to integrate public scholarship in our work, identify best practices for this type of work in the context of CSCW, including the ethical implications of outreach, and develop strategies to effectively support those most affected by the potential risks.",

      "abstract": "Guided by a human-centered design focus on users' needs, Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) research and practice have increasingly explored how to address the multiple inequities affecting historically marginalized groups. A growing body of CSCW and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, building upon education and community development literature, argues that centering on needs dismisses marginalized users' capacity for driving change. Needs-based views often lead to designs for the ``here and now,'' further marginalizing populations and perpetuating stereotypes. In contrast, an assets-based approach that puts users' knowledge, strengths, and capacities---assets---at the core of design can better promote sustained impact. Translating assets into meaningful designs that interact with intersecting systems of oppression, however, raises critical questions: What are assets? Whose assets are privileged? What ethical considerations surface when facilitating assets-based reflections? How can an assets-based design tackle systems-level problems? In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and industry actors to explore the implications of assets-based perspectives across domains, including Education, Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD), and Participatory Design (PD). Specifically, we will work to develop guidelines and methodologies for CSCW researchers and designers to identify when and how to pursue an assets-based approach, navigating issues of power to translate assets into design effectively.",

It will bring together interdisciplinary scholars, activists, practitioners and representatives of the public sector who wish to question and further develop the notion of scale generally associated with processes of upscaling. The workshop provides a forum to discuss: i) concepts, theories and empirical cases that broaden our view of what constitutes scale; and ii) the implications for CSCW research in assessing the long-term impact and sustenance of socio-technical innovations.

This workshop aims to bring together industry practitioners and academic researchers to discuss the opportunities and challenges of social AR: from platforms to content creation, to self-representation. We aim to use a design fiction approach where workshop participants create speculative scenarios that interrogate the values imbued into Social AR.

      "abstract": "Even though a restaurant may receive different ratings across review platforms, people often see only one rating during a local search (e.g. “best burgers near me”).  In this paper, we examine the differences in ratings between two commonly used review platforms—Google Maps and Yelp. We found that restaurant ratings on Google Maps are, on average, 0.7 stars higher than those on Yelp, with the increase being driven in large part by higher ratings for chain restaurants on Google Maps. We also found extensive diversity i¬¬n top-ranked restaurants by geographic region across platforms. For example, for a given metropolitan area, there exists little overlap in its top ten lists of restaurants on Google Maps and Yelp. Our results problematize the use of a single review platform in local search and have implications for end users of ratings and local search technologies. We outline concrete design recommendations to improve communication of restaurant evaluation and discuss the potential causes for the divergence we observed.",

It has also been applied universally to the design of collaborative systems, including application areas like education, knowledge work, and games, and more broadly as a theoretical framework in which to ground fundamental HCI research.

      "abstract": "Studying cultural variation in recollections of sociopolitical events is crucial for achieving diverse understandings of such events. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analyzing variation in texts describing events. Here, we analyze variation in image usage across Wikipedia language editions to understand if, like text, visual narratives reflect distinct perspectives in articles about culturally-tethered events. We focus on articles about coup d’états as an example of highly contextual sociopolitical events likely to display such variation. The key challenge to examining variation in images is that there is no existing framework to use as a basis for comparison. To address this challenge, we use an iterative inductive coding process to arrive at a 46-item typology for categorizing the content of images relating to contested sociopolitical events, and a typology of network motifs that characterizes structural patterns of image use. We apply these typologies in a large-scale quantitative analysis that establishes clusters of image themes, two detailed qualitative case studies comparing Wikipedia articles on coup d’états in Soviet Russia and Egypt, and four quantitative analyses clustering image themes by language usage at the article level. These analyses document variation in imagery around particular events and variation in tendencies across cultures. We find substantial cultural variation in both content and network structure. This study presents a novel methodological framework for uncovering culturally divergent perspective of political crises through imagery on Wikipedia.",

I examine factors that inform decisions to not disclose stigmatized experiences on identified social media. I conducted in-depth interviews with women in the U.S. who used social media, had experienced pregnancy loss, and had not disclosed about their loss on identified social media. I detail six types of factors related to the self, audience, network, society, platform, and temporality that contribute to non-disclosure decisions. I show that the Disclosure Decision-Making (DDM) framework introduced in prior work explaining disclosures when they do occur, also explains non-disclosure decisions on social media. I show how DDM builds from and bridges prior privacy theories, namely Communication Privacy management and Contextual Integrity. I discuss design implications around removing barriers to disclosure to facilitate beneficial disclosures and reduce stigma.",

      "abstract": "Voice assistants embodied in smart speakers (e.g., Amazon Echo,  Google Home) enable voice-basedinteraction that does not necessarily rely on expertise with mobile or desktop computing. Hence, these voice assistants offer new opportunities to different populations, including individuals who are not interested or able to use traditional computing devices such as computers and smartphones. To understand how older adults who use  technology  infrequently perceiveand usethese  voice  assistants,  we  conducted  a  three-week  field deployment of the Amazon Echo Dot in the homes of seven older adults. While some types of usage dropped over the three-week period (e.g., playing music), we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information washealth-related, this findingemphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g., setting timers, reminders) were initially perceived as useful, the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns. Wediscuss how these findingsapply to other user groups along with design implicationsand recommendations for future work on VUIs.",

      "abstract": "We are surrounded by digital images of personal lives posted online. Changes in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled widespread sharing of personal photos, increasing access to aspects of private life previously less observable. Most studies of privacy online explore differences in individual privacy preferences. Here we examine privacy perceptions of online photos considering both social norms, collectively- shared expectations of privacy, and individual preferences. We conducted an online factorial vignette study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (n=279). Our findings show that people share common expectations about the privacy of online images, and these privacy norms are socially contingent and multi-dimensional. Use of digital technologies to share personal photos is influenced by social context as well as individual preferences, while such sharing can affect the social meaning of privacy.",

Our analysis indicates major challenges for users in translating the activities they are working towards into specific tasks to be completed in a system comprehensible manner. Specifically, blind and low vision students learning to use accessible technologies struggled with organizing their activities, tracking the history and status of their operations, and understanding how the system was acting underneath these interactions. We discuss how activity-centered design can be applied to nonvisual interfaces to better match user behavior in a computational system.\r\n",

      "abstract": "We study the impact and interplay of social design features on the engagement behaviors toward usergenerated content on Facebook business pages. By examining the introduction of the “Reactions” feature on Facebook, we aim to understand how the introduction of a new engagement feature affects the overall engagement activities and the use of existing engagement features. We found evidence of a positive effect of Reactions on overall engagement levels. Furthermore, the introduction of the Reactions feature had heterogeneous effects on the use of existing engagement features. Posts that received Reactions also ended up receiving more Likes and Comments than what they would have received before the feature change. However, the opposite is true for posts that received no Reactions, although the effect sizes were small. These effects were detected within the first four weeks after the feature introduction, and persisted after six months, indicating long-term structural changes in users’ engagement behaviors.",

      "abstract": "When people communicate with each other, their choice of what to say is tied to their perceptions of the audience. For many communication channels, people have some ability to explicitly specify their audience members and the different roles they can play. While existing accounts of communication behavior have largely focused on how people tailor the content of their messages, we focus on the configuring of the audience as a complementary family of decisions in communication.\r\n\r\nWe formulate a general description of audience configuration choices, highlighting key aspects of the audience that could be configured to reflect a range of communicative goals. We then illustrate these ideas via a case study of email usage---a realistic domain where audience configuration choices are particularly fine-grained and explicit in how email senders fill the To and Cc address fields. In a large collection of enterprise emails, we explore how people configure their audiences, finding salient patterns relating a sender's choice of configuration to the types of participants in the email exchange, the content of the message, and the nature of the subsequent interactions. Our formulation and findings illustrate how audience configurations could be analyzed as meaningful communication choices, and frame research directions on audience configuration decisions in communication and collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Self-presentation in online digital social spaces has been a long standing research interest in HCI and CSCW. As online social spaces evolve towards more embodied digital representations, it is important to understand how users construct and experience their self and interact with others' self in new and more complicated ways, as it may introduce new opportunities and unseen social consequences. Using findings of an interview study (N=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in Social Virtual Reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. This study contributes to the growing body of CSCW literature on social VR by offering empirical evidence of how social VR platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices. We also expand the existing research agenda in CSCW on the increasing complexity of people’s self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems. ",

      "trackId": 11080,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? To understand this, we study participants' experiences, perceptions, and relationships following a hackathon. In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of \"feminist consciousness raising\" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just \"awareness-raising\", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.

      "abstract": "Decision support systems have a potential to improve work flows of experts in practice (e.g. therapist's evidence-based rehabilitation assessment). However, the adoption of these systems is challenging and the gains of these systems have not fully demonstrated yet. In this paper, we identified the needs of therapists to assess patient's functional abilities (e.g. alternative perspective on assessment with quantitative information on patient's exercise motions). As a result, we developed an intelligent decision support system that can identify salient features of assessment using reinforcement learning to assess the quality of motion and summarize patient-specific analysis. We evaluated this system with seven therapists using the dataset from 15 patients performing three exercises. The results show that our system is preferred over a traditional system without analysis while presenting more richer information ($p<0.1$) to significantly reduce effort on assessment ($p < 0.1$)} and increase the agreement on therapists' assessment from 0.6600 to 0.7108 F1-scores ($p < 0.01$). This work discusses the importance of human centered design and development of a decision support system that presents contextually relevant information and salient explanation on its prediction for better adoption in practice.",

      "abstract": "Women gig workers face unique challenges in on-demand platforms as gendered aspects of class, caste and labor participation intersect with moments of control experienced on the job. Through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in India has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women’s mobility and access to work.  This paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in Bangalore. We find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. Women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. Yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women’s lives in India. These mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker.",

      "abstract": "Machine-learned computer vision algorithms for tagging images are increasingly used by developers and researchers, having become popularized as easy-to-use \"cognitive services.'' Yet these tools struggle with gender recognition, particularly when processing images of women, people of color and non-binary individuals. Socio-technical researchers have cited data bias as a key problem; training datasets often over-represent images of people and contexts that convey social stereotypes. The social psychology literature explains that people learn social stereotypes, in part, by observing others in particular roles and contexts, and can inadvertently learn to associate gender with scenes, occupations and activities. Thus, we study the extent to which image tagging algorithms mimic this phenomenon. We design a controlled experiment, to examine the interdependence between algorithmic recognition of context and the depicted person's gender. In the spirit of auditing to understand machine behaviors, we create a highly controlled dataset of people images, imposed on gender-stereotyped backgrounds. Our methodology is reproducible and our code publicly available. Evaluating five proprietary algorithms, we find that in three, gender inference is hindered when a background is introduced. Of the two that \"see'' both backgrounds and gender, it is the one whose output is most consistent with human stereotyping processes that is superior in recognizing gender. We discuss the accuracy -- fairness trade-off, as well as the importance of auditing black boxes in better understanding this double-edged sword.",

Existing work focusing on the intersection between disease surveillance and social media usually puts emphasis on early prediction of diseases. However, there is a dearth of research that explores the utility of social media in public health crises by framing the responses of general public. In this connection, here we study the responses of general public in response to dengue outbreaks in the scarce-resource settings of Bangladesh. Our purpose is to explore the utility of pervasive social media health data in health research in the limited-resource settings of Bangladesh, where the availability and accessibility to government health data is limited. On the other hand, the lower Internet adoption rate in such areas make it difficult to seamlessly integrate such social media platforms in effective disease planning and intervention programs. Therefore, through this study, we aspire to explore the scope of effective policy making approaches based on the social media health data.",

Our results reveal seven key motivations: compliance, self-status seeking, general information seeking, job support,  entertainment, patriotism, and learning. This state-owned platform introduced a new model for official information dissemination and political communication through direct surveillance and monitoring, leveraging and fostering emotional attachment, and offering heterogeneous apolitical content. We discuss the intended and unintended ramifications of these components, highlighting the importance of future CSCW research to critically engage with pluralist political narratives situated in varied societies, especially those outside the reach of Western democracy.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "As online platforms become ubiquitous, there is growing concern that their use can potentially lead to negative outcomes in users’ lives. A central question in the literature studying this phenomenon is whether quantity of use is related to problematic offline effects like reduced sleep. This is often addressed by either analyzing self-reported measures of time spent online, which are generally inaccurate, or using objective metrics derived from server logs or tracking software. However, how these two types of time measures comparatively relate to problematic effects — whether they complement or are redundant with each other in predicting problematicity — remains unknown. Furthermore, transparent research in the literature is hindered by its focus on closed platforms with inaccessible data, as well as selective analytical decisions that may lead to reproducibility issues. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate the relationships between both self-reported and data-derived metrics of time spent and potentially problematic effects arising from use of an open, non-profit online chess platform. These effects include disruptions to sleep, relationships, school and work performance, and self-control. To this end, we distributed a gamified survey to players and linked their responses with publicly-available game logs. We find problematic effects to be associated with both self-reported and data-derived usage measures to similar degrees. However, analytical models incorporating both self-reported and actual time explain problematic effects significantly more effectively than models with either type of measure alone. Furthermore, these results persist across thousands of possible analytical decisions when using a robust and transparent statistical framework. This suggests that the two methods of measuring time spent measure contain distinct, complementary information about problematic usage outcomes and should be used in conjunction with each other.\r\n",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that intimate partner abusers use digital technologies to surveil their partners, including by installing spyware apps, compromising devices and online accounts, and employing social engineering tactics. However, to date, this form of privacy violation, called intimate partner surveillance (IPS), has primarily been studied from the perspective of victim-survivors. We present a qualitative study of how potential perpetrators of IPS harness the emotive power of sharing personal narratives to validate and legitimise their abusive behaviours. We analysed 556 stories of IPS posted on publicly accessible online forums dedicated to the discussion of sexual infidelity. We found that many users share narrative posts describing IPS as they boast about their actions, advise others on how to perform IPS without detection, and seek suggestions for next steps to take. We identify a set of common thematic story structures, justifications for abuse, and outcomes within the stories that provide a window into how these individuals believe their behaviour to be justified. Using these stories, we develop a four-stage framework that captures the change in a potential perpetrator’s approach to IPS. We use our findings and framework to guide a discussion of efforts to combat abuse, including how we can identify crucial moments where interventions might be safely applied to prevent or de-escalate IPS.",

      "abstract": "Small group interactions can expose people to diverse perspectives and inform the potential for longer-term collaboration. However, rapidly configuring groups and facilitating interactions among strangers can be difficult, especially in co-located settings. We present ProtoTeams, a system that leverages personal mobile devices to support rapid group formation, to facilitate group activities, and to collect data about the potential for future collaboration. We report on a field study where 406 students in eight different project-based classes used ProtoTeams to interact with classmates through multiple rounds of brief discussion activities before selecting teammates for a term project. We found that the system enables groups to form in about one minute, allows for meaningful interactions with a diverse range of peers, and can significantly influence subsequent teammate selection. We discuss design implications and challenges for in-person team dating in classrooms and other contexts.",

      "abstract": "People often create social media accounts and pages named after crisis events. We call such accounts and pages Crisis Named Resources (CNRs). CNRs share information about crisis events and are followed by many. Yet, they also appear suddenly (at crisis onset) and in most cases, the owners are unknown. Thus, it can be challenging for audiences in particular to know whether to trust (or not trust) these CNRs and the information they provide. In this study, we conducted surveys and interviews with members of the public and experts in crisis informatics, emergency response, and communication studies to evaluate the trustworthiness of CNRs named after the 2017 Hurricane Irma. Findings showed that participants evaluated trustworthiness based on their perceptions of a CNR’s content, information source, profile, and owner. Findings also show that if people perceive that a CNR owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help the public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation, they tend to trust that CNR. Participant demographics and expertise showed no effect on perceptions of trustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "Much HCI research seeks to contribute to technological agendas that lead to more just and participative labor relations and practices, yet that research also raises concerns about forms of exploitation associated with them. In this paper, we explore how U.S. independent [indie] game developers’ socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. Our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. The research contributes to HCI research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes.Our critical review of indie developers’ practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in CSCW.",

      "abstract": "Social virtual reality (social VR) is an emerging technology that has the potential to support unique social experiences for groups of older adults. In this paper we explore the use of social VR to support group reminiscence, an activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of older adults. We developed School Days, a bespoke social VR application that enables groups of geographically dispersed older adults to meet in a virtual environment to reminisce about their school experiences. We conducted a user study over the course of 5 months with 16 participants aged 70-81 to evaluate how School Days supported reminiscence. In this paper, we focus on how the use of reminiscence scaffolding features in School Days impacted on the older adults’ ability to participate more fully in the reminiscence activities. Our results illustrate the value of social VR for connecting older adults over distance, and contribute new knowledge of how virtual environments can be designed to scaffold reminiscence; how techniques such as 3D conversation starters and individual artefacts can be used to scaffold reminiscence; and how pre-recorded holographic stories (Avacasts) can be used to introduce new perspectives and prompt self-reflection. We contribute five design reflections aimed at guiding the design of future reminiscence tools in social VR",

      "abstract": "Remote collaborations are increasingly common, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. Visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been recently explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. However, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. This paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. We find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. Similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. Our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms support the sharing of written text, video, and audio. All of these formats may be inaccessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH), particularly those who primarily communicate via sign language, people who we call Deaf signers. We study how Deaf signers engage with social platforms, focusing on how they share content and the barriers they face. We employ a mixed-methods approach involving seven in-depth interviews and a survey of a larger population (n = 60). We find that Deaf signers share the most in written English, despite their desire to share in sign language. We further identify key areas of difficulty in consuming content (e.g., lack of captions for spoken content in videos) and producing content (e.g., captioning signed videos, signing into a phone camera) on social media platforms. Our results both provide novel insights into social media use by Deaf signers and reinforce prior findings on DHH communication more generally, while revealing potential ways to make social media platforms more accessible to Deaf signers.",

      "abstract": "A team's early interactions are influential: small behaviors cascade, driving the team either toward successful collaboration or toward fracture. Would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? We introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. Afterwards, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. In two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are more viable than those with fresh histories. Our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot—and stay there.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agents, it is important to understand the mechanisms that influence users' experiences of these agents.\r\nIn this paper, we study one of the most common tools in the designer's toolkit: conceptual metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler, or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our experience of the AI agent? Sampling a set of metaphors along the dimensions of warmth and competence---defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of variation for human social perception---we perform a study $(N=260)$ where we manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the agent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low competence agents featuring identical, human-level performance and the wizards being blind to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess effects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and warmth. Through a retrospective analysis, we notice an interesting correlation between our findings and actually observed user attitudes towards past conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.",

      "abstract": "Although suicide among older adults is increasing in severity in aging Korea, older adult depression and anxiety, which are two crucial factors affecting suicide in this population, are not effectively addressed by the status quo. Existing products and services emphasize physical needs and still lack a user-oriented approach. Moreover, offerings for mental health care are costly and exclude potential users from the development process, thus inhibiting older adults from having better access to those services. To address this problem, we designed and developed a mental health care chatbot, Yeonheebot, to decrease anxiety and depression among older adults. Yeonheebot initiates conversations regarding daily care for the well-being of older adults and provides features related to their interests as initiatives for using the mental health care chatbot. To examine if a short-term, yet repeating conversation with the agent could help reduce anxiety and depression among older adults, we conducted a 2-week field study with 25 users. Results indicate the constant use of Yeonheebot decreased levels of anxiety and depression by 36% and 18%, respectively. Our research implies that simple and repeating interactions could help Korean older adults cope with anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "Given the importance and social significance of passing down family stories to each generation, why do important family stories not get told? How should designers of digital family storytelling platforms address missing or incomplete parts of narratives? Drawing from the results of an interview-based, practice-oriented inquiry, we argue that non-telling should be considered an important and integral part of family storytelling. Our findings show that non-telling is not simply silence. Non-telling allows family members to observe protective and discretionary values essential to the identity-making and relational goals of family storytelling. We also show ways that a person's reticence is situated and may change over time. In our discussion, we provide design strategies for family storytelling technologies to make room for silence and incorporate the values, purposes, and practices of non-telling.",

      "abstract": "A central process of virtual organization design relates to how newcomers are assimilated into organizational dynamics. Research on organizational assimilation has traditionally investigated “serious” organizational contexts. Nonetheless, video games can offer insights on how such assimilation can be effectively supported. In this article, I propose to look at World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how individuals can be successfully integrated into online organizations. Through an ethnographic research, made up of participant observation and 36 semi-structured interviews, I explore the role that specific game design elements have in supporting organizational assimilation into WoW raiding guilds. This role is particularly relevant because it shows how designers can elicit extremely engaging organizational dynamics, which encourage players to identify with their organizations. On the basis of the study findings, I also propose some design considerations, as practical implications of the research, to gamify virtual organizations that may present similarities with WoW raiding guilds.",

      "abstract": "We present a qualitative study of how personal accounts on online services, such as Tinder, Netflix and Spotify, may be shared in particular social situations. We draw from agency theory’s focus on principal–agent relationships and Goffman’s work on frames in analysing situations where others are allowed to use personal accounts, either for a shared purpose or on behalf of the account owner. We deploy Goffman’s concepts of regrounding to understand how interests behind activities are transformed and brackets to draw attention to the boundaries of different frames, and how these are incurred or broken in situations that exceed personal account use. Based on a set of 43 written descriptions of account sharing, we depict how employing others to act as agents to use one’s personal accounts may lead to playful or serious use. Additionally, we discuss consequentiality of sharing personalised services, considering both what services might reveal about the account owner and how sharing takes place in the context of relationships. We contribute by illustrating how users' relationships with personalised services are complicated by the different interests that are served when accounts are shared.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "While online developer forums are major resources of knowledge for application developers, their roles in promoting better privacy practices remain under explored. In this paper, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a sample of 207 threads (4772 unique posts) mentioning different forms of personal data from the /r/androiddev forum on Reddit. We started with bottom-up open coding on the sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. Our results show that Android developers rarely discussed privacy concerns when talking about a specific app design or implementation problems, but often had active discussions around privacy when stimulated by certain external events representing new privacy-enhancing restrictions from the Android operating system, app store policies, or privacy laws. Developers often felt these restrictions could cause considerable cost yet fail to generate any compelling benefit for themselves. Given these results, we present a set of suggestions for Android OS and the app store to design more effective methods to enhance privacy, and for developer forums (e.g.,  /r/androiddev) to encourage more in-depth privacy discussions and nudge developers to think more about privacy.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing systems aggregate decisions of many people to help identify high-quality options, such as the best answers to questions or interesting news stories. \r\nA long-standing issue in crowdsourcing is how option quality and human judgement heuristics interact to affect collective outcomes, such as the perceived popularity of options. We address this limitation by conducting a controlled experiment where subjects choose between two ranked options whose quality can be independently varied. We use this data to construct a model that quantifies how judgement heuristics and option quality combine when deciding between two options. The model reveals popularity-ranking is unstable below a critical point: if the quality difference between the two options is sufficiently high, the higher quality option is eventually ranked on top, however, below a certain quality difference this is not guaranteed. To rectify the instability, we create an algorithm that accounts for judgement heuristics to infer the best option and ranks it first. This method is guaranteed to be optimal if data matches the model, and simulations show that this method performs better or at least as well as popularity-based and recency-based ranking for any two-choice question. Our work suggests that algorithms relying on inference of mathematical models of user behavior can substantially improve outcomes in crowdsourcing systems.",

      "abstract": "Online communities provide spaces for people who are vulnerable and underserved to seek support and build community, such as people who identify as LGBTQ+. Today, some online community spaces are mediated by algorithms. Scholarship has found that algorithms have become deeply embedded in the systems that mediate our routine engagements with the world. Yet, little is known about how these systems impact those who are most vulnerable in society. In this paper, we focus on people's everyday experiences with one algorithmic system, the short video sharing application TikTok. TikTok recently received press that it was suppressing and oppressing the identities of its growing LGBTQ+ user population through algorithmic and human moderation of LGBTQ+ creators and content related to LGBTQ+ identity. Through an interview study with 16 LGBTQ+ identifying TikTok users, we explore people’s everyday engagements and encounters with the platform. We find that TikTok’s For You Page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that at once support LGBTQ+ identity work and reaffirm LGBTQ+ identity, while also transgressing and violating the identities of individual users. We also find that people are developing self-organized practices in response to these transgressions and violations. We discuss the implications of algorithmic systems on people's identity work, and introduce the concept of algorithmic exclusion, and explore how people are building resilience following moments of algorithmic exclusion.",

      "abstract": "Local governments still depend on traditional town halls for community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. Building on a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers, we designed and developed CommunityClick, a communitysourcing system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports. During the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iClickers to give voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time feedback beyond a binary signal. This information then automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. The augmented transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write reports. From a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we demonstrate how CommunityClick can improve inclusivity by providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions. Additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate CommunityClick’s utility in creating more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. We discuss the possibility of integrating CommunityClick with town hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other domains.",

      "abstract": "It is still a challenge to detect anomalous events in video sequences in the field of computer vision due to heavy object occlusions, varying crowded densities and complex situations. To address this, we propose a novel human-machine cooperative approach which uses human feedback on anomaly confirmation to inform and enhance video anomaly detection. Specifically, we analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of sequential frames of a video from the appearance and motion perspective from which spatial and temporal features are identified and extracted. We then develop a convolutional autoencoder neural network to compute an abnormal score based on reconstruction errors. In this process, a group of experts will provide human feedback to a certain proportion of classified frames to be incorporated into the model, and also the final judgment for the event anomalies for training and classification. The proposed approach is evaluated on 3 publicly available surveillance datasets, showing improved accuracy and competitive performance (93.7% AUC) with respect to the best performance (90.6% AUC) of the state-of-the-art approaches. The approach has not been previously seen to the best of our knowledge.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "The emergence of team-assembling technologies has brought with it new challenges in designing and implementing socio-technical systems. Our understanding of how systems shape the team assembly processes is still limited. How do systems enable users to find teammates? How do users make decisions when using these systems? And what factors explain the characteristics of the teams assembled? Building on existing literature from CSCW, computer science, and management science, we propose a conceptual framework called the \"Model of Online Team Assembly\" (MOTA) to characterize how users and systems configure team assembly in computer-mediated environments. This framework argues that two dimensions determine how systems influence team assembly: (i) to what extent users can exercise their agency, and (ii) how many users can participate in the team formation process. The intersection of these two dimensions manifest four types of teams enabled by systems: self-assembled teams, staffed teams, optimized teams, and augmented teams. We characterize each one of these types of teams, considering their qualities, advantages, and challenges. To contextualize these types of teams, we map existing studies and systems using a scoping literature review. Lastly, we discuss ways through which these two dimensions alter users' behavior, team diversity, and team composition. This paper provides theoretical implications and research questions for future systems that reconfigure the organization of people into teams.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate Artificial Intelligence systems. Modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. Such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. As a result, recent work has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. Reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex HITs without bearing the financial risk of  not being rewarded for  completed work. We experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. Our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not affected as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.",

      "abstract": "Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers.  Based on the deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72\\% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds of times more results than the default Dribble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity in online discussions has been an intriguing phenomenon and an important problem. In this paper, we seek to better understand toxicity dynamics in online discussions via a case study on Reddit that explores the antecedents and consequences of toxicity in text. We inspected two dimensions of toxicity: language toxicity, i.e. how toxic the text itself is; and toxicity elicitation, i.e. how much toxicity it elicits in its response. Through regression analyses on Reddit comments, we found that both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context were strong positive antecedents of language toxicity; meanwhile, language toxicity significantly increased the volume and user evaluation of the discussion in some sub-communities, while toxicity elicitation showed mixed effects. We then discuss how our results help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions by interpreting the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity.",

There is a vital need for engaging, sustainable, and scalable resources to support social, physical and emotional wellbeing amongst caregivers of PWD. To explore this open design space, we designed and conducted a 6-week mixed-method evaluation of CareGarden, a pervasive social exergame in which flowers grow as users increase physical activity and interact with other caregivers of PWD. Our findings showed that using CareGarden helped participants relieve stress, increase physical activity, and develop empathy for and patience towards the loved one with dementia that they cared for. At the same time, tension arose as some caregivers desired to learn about the life challenges that CareGarden users faced while others hesitated to share such content. We discuss our findings and recommendations for future technology that promotes caregivers’ time for themselves, understanding of PWD, and connections with other caregivers. ",

      "abstract": "In chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in making sense of and managing illness over time. Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and provides; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspective. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.\r\n",

      "trackId": 11080,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Several prominent studies have shown that the imbalanced on-screen exposure of observable phenotypic traits like gender and skin-tone in movies, TV shows, live telecasts, and other visual media can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes in society. Researchers and human rights organizations alike have long been calling to make media producers more aware of such stereotypes. While awareness among media producers is growing, balancing the presence of different phenotypes in a video requires substantial manual effort and can typically only be done in the post-production phase. The task becomes even more challenging in the case of a live telecast where video producers must make instantaneous decisions with no post-production phase to refine or revert a decision. In this paper, we propose Screen-Balancer, an interactive tool that assists media producers in balancing the presence of different phenotypes in a live telecast. The design of Screen-Balancer is informed by a field study conducted in a professional live studio. Screen-Balancer analyzes the facial features of the actors to determine phenotypic traits using facial detection packages; it then facilitates real-time visual feedback for interactive moderation of gender and skin-tone distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study with 20 participants and asked them to compose live telecasts from a set of video streams simulating different camera angles, and featuring several male and female actors with different skin-tones. The study revealed that the participants were able to reduce the difference of screen times of male and female actors by 43%, and that of light-skinned and dark-skinned actors by 44%, thus showing the promise and potential of using such a tool in commercial production systems.",

      "abstract": "Wikipedia edit-a-thon events provide a targeted approach to incorporating new knowledge into the online encyclopedia while also offering pathways toward new editor participation. Through the analysis of interviews with 13 edit-a-thon facilitators, however, we find motivations for running edit-a-thons extend far beyond adding content and editors. In this paper, we uncover how a range of personal and institutional values inspire these event facilitators toward fulfilling broader goals, including fostering information literacy and establishing community relationships outside of Wikipedia. Along with reporting motivations, values, and goals, we also describe strategies the facilitators adopt in their practice. Next, we discuss challenges faced by facilitators as they organize edit-a-thons. We situate our findings within two complementary theoretical lenses—information ecologies and public pedagogy—to guide our interpretation. Finally, we suggest new ways in which edit-a-thons, as well as similar peer production events and communities, can be understood, studied, and evaluated.",

      "trackId": 11080,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Since the emergence of so-called fake news on the Internet and in social media, platforms such as Facebook have started to take countermeasures, and researchers have begun looking into this phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. A large number of scientific work has investigated ways to detect fake news automatically. Less attention has been paid to the subsequent step, i.e., what to do when you are aware of the inaccuracy of claims in social media. This work takes a user-centered approach on means to counter identified misinformation in social networks. We conduct a three-step study design on how approaches in social media should be presented in order to respect the users’ needs and experiences and how effective they are. As our first step, in an online survey representative to the German adult population, we enquire regarding their strategies on handling information in social media, and their opinion regarding possible solutions — focusing on the approach of displaying a warning on inaccurate posts. In a second step, we present five potential approaches to interviewees for qualitative input. Based on the interview feedback, as the third step of this study, we select, improve, and examine four promising approaches. We conduct a representative online experiment to test their effectiveness on the perceived accuracy of false headlines and also ask for the users’ preferences. In this study, we find that users welcome warning-based approaches to counter fake news and are somewhat critical with less transparent methods. Moreover, users want social media platforms to explain why a post was marked as disputed. The results regarding effectiveness are similar: Warning-based approaches are shown to be effective in reducing the perceived accuracy of false headlines. Moreover, adding an explanation to the warning leads to the most significant results. In contrast, we could not find a significant effect for one of Facebook’s current approaches (reduced post size and fact-checks in related articles).",

      "abstract": "Checklists and action plans are a proven mechanism for project-based collaboration. Synthesizing project-specific plans is challenging, as project managers must consider multiple sources of information, from structured surveys to semi-structured conversations with stakeholders. In a needfinding study with project managers, we identified challenges in creating action plans for teams. We built SYSTEM X, a mixed-initiative system that addressed these challenges with three components: a semi-structured note-taking interface for capturing stakeholder conversations, a plan generator for automatically combining multi-source information into action plans, and classification models for assigning and prioritizing action items. We evaluated SYSTEM X in an observational study of 32 website design projects. Compared to a previously unstructured process, SYSTEM X generated 1.45X as many tasks that are more consistent, while reducing the plan creation time by 33.70%. Through interviews and surveys, we found that participants rate SYSTEM X highly across several measures. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and opportunities for mixed-initiative action plan creation.",

      "abstract": "Writing is a complex non-linear process that begins with a mental model of intent, and progresses through an outline of ideas, to words on paper (and their subsequent refinement). Despite past research in understanding writing, Web-scale consumer and enterprise collaborative digital writing environments are yet to greatly benefit from intelligent systems that understand the stages of document evolution, providing opportune assistance based on authors’ situated actions and context. In this paper, present three studies that explore temporal stages of document authoring. We first survey information workers at a large technology company about their writing habits and preferences, concluding that writers do in fact conceptually progress through several distinct phases while authoring documents. We also explore, qualitatively, how writing stages are linked to document lifespan. We supplement these qualitative findings with an analysis of the longitudinal user interaction logs of a popular digital writing platform over several million documents. Finally, as a first step towards facilitating an intelligent digital writing assistant, we conduct a preliminary investigation into the utility of user interaction log data for predicting the temporal stage of a document. Our results support the benefit of tools tailored to writing stages, identify primary tasks associated with these stages, and show that it is possible to predict stages from anonymous interaction logs. Together, these results argue for the benefit and feasibility of more tailored digital writing assistance.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today’s working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as \"post-OT\" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors.  On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and often portrayed OT as an incorrect and inefficient technique.  Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors; OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today’s co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT’s purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. These discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between OT and CRDT in the real world. We report these results in a series of three articles. \r\n\r\n    In this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between OT and CRDT in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. Moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative CRDT solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of OT and CRDT.  We hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications. \r\n",

      "abstract": "Attracting and retaining newcomers is critical and challenging for online production communities such as Wikipedia, both because volunteers need specialized training and are likely to leave before being integrated into the community. In response to these challenges, the Wikimedia Foundation started the Wiki Education Project (Wiki Ed), an online program in which college students edit Wikipedia articles as class assignments. The Wiki Ed program incorporates many components of  institutional socialization, a process many conventional organizations successfully use to integrate new employees  through formalized on-boarding practices. Research has not adequately investigated whether Wiki Ed and similar programs are effective ways to integrate volunteers in online communities, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. This paper evaluates the Wiki Ed program by comparing 16,819 student editors in 770 Wiki Ed classes with new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way. The evaluation shows that the Wiki Ed students did more work, improved articles more, and were more committed to Wikipedia. For example, compared to new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way they were twice as likely to still be editing Wikipedia a year after their Wiki Ed class was finished. Further, students in classrooms that encouraged joint activity, a key component of institutional socialization, produced better quality work than those in classrooms where students worked independently. These findings are consistent with an interpretation that the Wiki Ed program was successful because it incorporated elements of institutionalized socialization.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "In ``smart speaker'' digital assistant systems such as Google Home, there is no visual user interface, so people must learn about the system's capabilities and limitations by experimenting with different questions and commands. However, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. This is a problem for both the user and the system. Users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. Symbiosis---a mutually beneficial relationship---between AI systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. In order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users' subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. We conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the Google Home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. We found that the most common response from the Google Home, a version of ``Sorry, I'm not sure how to help'', provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question.\r\nHowever, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. We discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants.",

      "abstract": "Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can support grassroots social movements toward greater outreach and better day-to-day communication. In this paper, we present the results of action research with a large-scale grassroots social movement, the Southern Movement Assembly (SMA), exploring their uses and perceptions of ICTs. We find that the ICTs chosen by the SMA are often at odds with their grassroots culture of inclusion and participation---which results in  inequitable sociotechnical realities within the movement. For example, people with technical skills gain more power as they start to control organizational processes. As technical skills are most commonly associated with racial, gender, and socioeconomic privileges, this leads to inequitable participation. We conclude by calling for a grassroots culture of technology practice rooted in analyses of systemic exclusion with a continuous effort to center the marginalized voices and experiences with technology.",

      "abstract": "When online platforms rise and fall, sometimes communities fade away, and sometimes they pack their bags and relocate to a new home. To explore the causes and effects of online community migration, we examine transformative fandom, a longstanding, technology-agnostic community surrounding the creation, sharing, and discussion of creative works based on existing media. For over three decades, community members have left and joined many different online spaces, from Usenet to Tumblr to platforms of their own design. Through analysis of 28 in-depth interviews and 1,886 survey responses from fandom participants, we traced these migrations, the reasons behind them, and their impact on the community. Our findings highlight catalysts for migration that provide insights into factors that contribute to success and failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy, design, and community. Further insights into the disruptive consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost content) suggest ways that platforms might both support commitment and better support migration when it occurs.",

      "abstract": "Social Networking Sites (SNS) offer youth activists and youth empowerment organizations (where adults help youth address community issues) opportunities for civic action. Impression management is critical to youth empowerment organizations' work online, as they attempt to influence the opinions of their audience. However, there is a dearth of research characterizing online impression management in the context of youth empowerment organizations. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study investigating the use of SNS in a youth empowerment organization. Using Goffman's dramaturgical model, we characterized how youth tried to hack SNS algorithms, and their desire to better identify their audience.  Our findings reveal how youth use SNS to create authentic images and connections with their audience. On the other hand, we discuss adults' desire to convey a curated organizational image and challenges that arose. We conclude with design implications for tools that support impression management online for youth activists.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the peer-to-peer economy has grown exponentially, particularly in the ride-sharing sector. This growth has been accompanied by a muddying between the sharing and gig economy, and it has become unclear when an activity is sharing a resource vs. providing a service. To unpack this difference, we studied two successful carpooling groups (university students traveling home and offices commuting), which we contrast with previous literature on ride-hailing apps (e.g. Uber). The two communities that we studied differ in that: offices, had more routine ride-sharing needs based on their commute; and students, arranged rides to return home for school breaks or long weekends. We detail how common needs and backgrounds impacted how carpoolers treated each other. Leveraging these findings, we outline design paths for both the sharing and gig economies to better realize the ideas of the sharing economy.",

      "trackId": 11079,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. It is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). Linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. Do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? In order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (N=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. We design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. These two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. Users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. They are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. Analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. We find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. Compared to the Always code-mix policy, Nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. Nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. These findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style.",

      "abstract": "As the use of machine learning (ML) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conduct 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ML models. The characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models, but also between people within the organization. We present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research direction that can better address real-world needs.",

We conducted interviews with 21 moderators of AAPI subreddits to understand how sociotechnical systems contour and contribute to the marginalization of online communities. We examine marginalization through the analytic framework of decolonization and uncover the threats and tactics that AAPI redditors encounter and employ to decolonize their collective identity. We find that moderators of AAPI subreddits develop collective resilience within their online communities by reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. We discuss how algorithmic configurations within sociotechnical systems reaffirm existing hegemonic values, and we describe how users and designers of sociotechnical systems can work toward resistance.",

      "abstract": "Although peer support technologies are critical resources for patients managing health conditions, they do not address the needs of patients in the hospital (i.e., inpatients) or the unique design constraints of this healthcare setting. To examine how the design of these technologies can meet the needs of inpatients, we conducted a technology probe study with 30 pediatric and adult inpatients. We created the Patient Advice System (PAS) to enable peer support in the hospital setting, then studied how participants used and perceived it during their stay. Inpatients used the PAS to exchange emotional support and share peer advice on a range of topics (e.g., adjusting to the hospital, communicating with providers). They identified several benefits (e.g., fostered connections) and challenges (e.g., competing clinical priorities) with using the PAS in the real-world context of their hospital stay. Based on our findings, we discuss three design opportunities—highlighting local expertise, designing for dynamic engagement, and providing low-burden forms of peer support—for future peer support technologies to empower inpatients and overcome the difficulties they face within the hospital.

      "abstract": "Whether to give rights to artificial intelligence (AI) and robots has been a sensitive topic since the European Parliament proposed advanced robots could be granted \"electronic personalities.\" Numerous scholars who favor or disfavor its feasibility have participated in the debate. This paper presents an experiment (N=1270) that 1) collects online users' first impressions of 11 possible rights that could be granted to autonomous electronic agents of the future and 2) examines whether debunking common misconceptions on the proposal modifies one's stance toward the issue. The results indicate that even though online users mainly disfavor AI and robot rights, they are supportive of protecting electronic agents from cruelty (i.e., favor the right against cruel treatment). Furthermore, their perceptions shifted in a positive direction when given information about rights-bearing non-human entities or myth-refuting statements. The style used to introduce AI and robot rights significantly affected how the participants perceived the proposal, similar to the way metaphors function in creating laws. For robustness, the experiment was repeated over a more representative sample of U.S. residents (N=164), which suggests that perceptions gathered by the online users and those by the general population are similar.",

      "abstract": "Social e-commerce, as a new form of social computing based marketing platforms, utilizes existing real-world social relationships for promotions and sales of products. It has been growing rapidly in recent years and attracted tens of millions of users in China. A key group of actors who enable market transactions on these platforms are intermediaries who connect producers with consumers by sharing information with and recommending products to their real-world social contacts. Despite their crucial role, the nature and behavior of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms has not been systematically analyzed. Here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed method study. Leveraging 9 months’ all-round behavior of 39,564,525 users on Beidian – one of the largest social e-commerce sites in China, alongside with qualitative evidence from online forums and interviews, we examine characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns and uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. We demonstrate that intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend detectors and “social grocers”. Furthermore, successful intermediaries are highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden items for promotion. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms, which provides potential insights for the design and management of social computing marketing platforms.",

      "abstract": "Game-based second language (L2) learning represents an ideal alternative to foreign language classroom instruction. However, despite a diverse player demographic, the design of L2 games is often not informed by players representative of marginalized populations, especially women of color (i.e., Black women). Such oversight in the design process contributes to games that perpetuate gendered and racist stereotypes, and therefore, are less appealing to women of color. In response this dilemma, we utilize Black Feminist Thought(BFT) as a critical framework to engage Black women, a marginalized and understudied population within the gaming subculture, and more broadly, the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) community, in game design. Twenty-five Black women take on multiple roles as game designers, foreign language instructor,and informants who represent both producers and consumers throughout the conceptualization phase of a L2mobile game prototype. Applying BFT principles, we leverage Black women's lived intersectional experiences to transform the traditional game design process into a more inclusive design experience for Black women. In the context of games that support L2 learning, our findings reveal that Black women appreciate games that: 1. provide authentic cultural experiences; 2. feature intersectional game characters that reflect real lifeexperiences; 3. accurately portray the diversity of Black women’s bodies; and 4. provide opportunities for players to customize game assets. As a disruptor to traditional game design, BFT makes salient oppressive design practices within the gaming culture that also extend to the larger CSCW community, signifying the need to embrace more inclusive design practices that benefit Black women and other marginalized populations.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members’ abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams.",

      "abstract": "Today eSports gaming is enjoying growing popularity in the world and much attention from various research areas, including CSCW. eSports gaming is a highly competitive environment commonly associated with negative emotions such as anxiety and stress. However, little attention has been paid to emotion regulation in eSports gaming. In this study, we empirically investigated how players experience emotion and regulate emotions in League of Legends, one of the largest eSports games today. We identify four emotive factors, as well as emotion regulation strategies that players deploy to manage the emotions of their selves, teammates, and opponents. We further report on how they use emotion regulation in emotional self-care and emotional leadership. Building upon this set of findings, we discuss how the competitive eSports gaming context conditions emotion regulation in League of Legends, foreground emotion regulation expertise in competitive gaming, and derive implications for designing emotion regulation technologies.",

      "abstract": "Writing is a common task for crowdsourcing researchers exploring complex and creative work. To better understand how we write with crowds, we conducted both a literature review of crowd-writing systems and structured interviews with designers of such systems.  We argue that the cognitive process theory of writing described by Flower and Hayes (College Composition and Communication, 1981), originally proposed as a theory of how solo writers write, offers a useful analytic lens for examining the design of crowd-writing systems.  This lens enabled us to identify system design challenges that are inherent to the process of writing as well as design challenges that are introduced by crowdsourcing.  The findings present both similarities and differences between how solo writers write versus how we write with crowds. To conclude, we discuss how the research community might apply and transcend the cognitive process model to identify opportunities for future research in crowd-writing system design.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. To date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. Instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. To do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. Community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. Using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. Our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.",

      "abstract": "Exploring communication dynamics in digital social spaces such as massively multiplayer online games and 2D/3D virtual worlds has been a long standing concern in HCI and CSCW. As online social spaces evolve towards more natural embodied interaction, it is important to explore how non-verbal communication can be supported in more nuanced ways in these spaces and introduce new social interaction consequences. In this paper we especially focus on understanding novel non-verbal communication in social virtual reality (VR). We report findings of two empirical studies. Study 1 collected observational data to explore the types of non-verbal interactions being used naturally in social VR. Study 2 was an interview study (N=30) that investigated people’s perceptions of non-verbal communication in social VR as well as the resulting interaction outcomes. This study helps address the limitations in prior literature on non-verbal communication dynamics in online social spaces. Our findings on what makes non-verbal communication in social VR unique and socially desirable extend our current understandings of the role of non-verbal communication in social interaction. We also highlight potential design implications that aim at better supporting non-verbal communication in social VR.",

      "abstract": "Interest has grown in designing algorithmic decision making systems for contestability. In this work, we study how users experience contesting unfavorable social media content moderation decisions. A large-scale online experiment tests whether different forms of appeals can improve users’ experiences of automated decision making. We study the impact on users’ perceptions of the Fairness, Accountability, and Trustworthiness of algorithmic decisions, as well as their feelings of Control (FACT). Surprisingly, we find that none of the appeal designs improve FACT perceptions compared to a no appeal baseline. We qualitatively analyze how users write appeals, and find that they contest the decision itself, but also more fundamental issues like the goal of moderating content, the idea of automation, and the inconsistency of the system as a whole. We conclude with suggestions for – as well as a discussion of the challenges of – designing for contestability.",

      "trackId": 11079,
      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Online social networks (OSN) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. OSN users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. The messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. This could result in miscommunication. Previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. However, there is a lack of such studies in the context of OSN.  In this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and English language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. We collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. Further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. Our analysis indicates that age, English language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. We also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on OSNs. We conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Crowdsourcing marketplaces have provided a large number of opportunities for online workers to earn a living. To improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks.  The rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. Prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. There are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. To this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. Our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how  conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. Results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an Involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. Our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing.",

      "abstract": "Social Networking Sites (SNS) provide a platform for engaging youth in activism (e.g., by helping mobilize civic action). While youth typically employ casual approaches to online activism (i.e., quick actions, such as broadcast posts to advertise social justice events), more strategic practices (i.e., those that are more creative and informed) can increase the likelihood of successful online campaigns. However, little work has examined how youth activists can be supported to use SNS more strategically. To address this research gap, we conducted interviews with youth activists, exploring how youth made sense of social network visualizations and their perspectives on how such tools could support their activism efforts. Our findings characterize how participants made inferences about followers’ identities based on their hashtag use, and how they used those inferences in outreach decisions.

      "abstract": "Online health communities offer the promise of support benefits to users, in particular because these communities enable users to find peers with similar experiences. Building mutually supportive connections between peers is a key motivation for using online health communities.  However, a user's role in a community may influence the formation of peer connections.  In this work, we study patterns of peer connections between two structural health roles: patient and non-professional caregiver. We examine user behavior in an online health community—CaringBridge.org—where finding peers is not explicitly supported.  This context lets us use social network analysis methods to explore the growth of such connections in the wild and identify users' peer communication preferences.  We investigated how connections between peers were initiated, finding that initiations are more likely between two authors who have the same role and who are close within the broader communication network.  Relationships—patterns of repeated interactions—are also more likely to form and be more interactive when authors have the same role.  Our results have implications for the design of systems supporting peer communication, e.g. peer-to-peer recommendation systems.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Modern technology promises to improve service encounters by automated documentation or better decision traceability. At the same time, research suggests negative impact of technology on human-to-human advisory services: including technology might negatively impact the interpersonal communication and enforce unpleasant behaviors. Consequently, despite the obvious improvements, technology might have negative impact on how the participants perceive the service. This might imply serious consequences for the service provider: unsatisfied clients, ineffective information exchange, or intransparency. This slows down the diffusion of technology into advisory services in banks or insurance companies and so designing systems for use in interpersonal services remains a challenge. This article provides evidence that LivePaper, a system designed along the material practices of a financial advisory encounter, helps improving important service quality dimensions, turning the services not only more pleasant for the participants, but also improving key marketing and business metrics of the service. In experimental advisory services, the sessions supported with LivePaper outperformed conventional services with regard to overall bank service quality and satisfaction, salesperson listening and interaction rating scores, as well as information transparency. This shows that carefully designed system does not only preserve the perceived quality of a service but might improve it and has implications on the marketing and business value of the service.",

      "abstract": "On-skin displays are emerging as a wearable form factor for the display of information; however, the perception of using such devices in public could determine whether they are eventually adopted or rejected. This study investigated the means by which on-skin notification displays are perceived by the general public. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to the analysis of results from an online survey (n = 254) and in-lab interviews (n = 36) pertaining to the novel form factor, device materiality, and envisioned use cases. The study was conducted in the US and Taiwan in order to examine cross-cultural attitudes toward device usage. The results of this structured examination provide valuable insights into the design of on-skin notification displays for everyday use across cultures. ",

      "abstract": "The Hindu caste system plays an important role in the socio-political landscape of India. In recent years, Indian politicians have moved a lot of direct communication online. Social media is now an important space for the articulation and performance of their political positions. In this paper, we study ways in which the political performance of caste relations can be captured from the online connections and messaging of parliamentarians in India. We run tests of odds ratios among the members of LokSabha (lower house) of India to find the extent to which their engagement is insular to their own caste group versus other groups. We observe that in the LokSabha network, Members of Parliament (MPs) have higher odds of getting retweeted by others whose caste is the same or closer to their own in the caste hierarchy. The findings of this research shed light on an understudied, yet critical, social relation of caste in the study of political behavior on social media.",

      "abstract": "Resulting from treatment advances, HIV is now a long-term condition, and digital solutions are being developed to support people living with HIV in self-management. Sharing their health data with their peers may support self-management, but the trust, identity, privacy and security (TIPS) considerations of people living with HIV remain underexplored. Our interviews with 26 people living with HIV in the UK investigated how to design a peer data sharing platform. We show that participants were highly sophisticated in their understanding of trust and in their requirements for robust privacy and security. They indicated willingness to share digital identity attributes, including gender, age, medical history, health and well-being data, but not details that could reveal their personal identity. Participants called for TIPS measures to foster and to sustain responsible data sharing within their community. These findings can inform the development of trustworthy digital platforms that enable people living with HIV to share data with their peers and provide insights for researchers who wish to facilitate data sharing in other communities with stigmatised health conditions.",

      "abstract": "Journalists are increasingly investigating and reporting on problematic online content such as misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories, leading to the creation of a new misinformation beat. The process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. It is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. Through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. Our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges. We highlight and discuss how journalistic values could be better embedded into the design of tools to support their work, the power dynamics between social media companies and journalists, and the promise of collaborations as a way to support and educate journalists on this beat. This work provides contextual knowledge to researchers looking to better support investigative journalists — on the misinformation beat and beyond — as their work becomes more entangled in sociotechnical systems.",

      "abstract": "Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.",

      "abstract": "Cultural probes have long been used in HCI to provide designers with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are designing, and thereby inspire novel design proposals. HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new design approaches. However, few use this subjective, and design-led method in their research. In this paper, I present a case study detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes in Bungoma, Kenya. Returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities draw attention to probe recipients’ unique experiences and to Bungoma’s distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. My experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design.  More broadly, I offer a case study demonstrating an alternative way to approach design in HCI4D/ICTD. ",

      "abstract": "Misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. The crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 4 crowd and expert groups on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science. Examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also point to a way to reduce the gap by designing tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and type of content.",

      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "Problematic search query completion suggestions -- perceived as biased, offensive, or in some other way harmful -- can reinforce existing stereotypes and misbeliefs, and even nudge users towards undesirable patterns of behavior.  Locating such suggestions is difficult, not only due to the long-tailed nature of web search, but also due to differences in how people assess potential harms.  Grounding our study in web search query logs, we explore when system-provided suggestions might be perceived as problematic through a series of crowd-experiments where we systematically manipulate:   the search query fragments provided by users, possible user search intents, and the list of query completion suggestions. To understand of why query suggestions might be perceived as problematic, we contrast them to an inventory of known types of problematic suggestions.  We report our observations around differences in the prevalence of  a) suggestions that are problematic on their own versus  b) suggestions that are problematic for the query fragment provided by a user, for both common informational needs and in the presence of web search voids -- topics searched by few to no users.  Our experiments surface a rich array of scenarios where suggestions are considered problematic, including due to the context in which they were surfaced.  Compounded by the elusive nature of many such scenarios, the prevalence of suggestions perceived as problematic only for certain user inputs, raises concerns about blind spots due to data annotation practices that may lead to some types of problematic suggestions being overlooked.",

      "tags": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "abstract": "This paper presents a study of a messaging interface prototype for online dating intended to improve women’s face-to-face meeting decisions, and therefore the capacity to manage the gendered risks involved with such meetings. The interface prompts users with discussion topics that are potentially more valuable for user evaluation than the impression management-motivated topics often chosen by men. These topics come in the form of first-date scenarios that messaging partners either agree or disagree on. Through a mixed-methods study utilizing speed dating events, daters used the interface to interact before meeting face-to-face. Results indicate that women’s face-to-face meeting decisions improve when the interface prompts them to discuss scenarios involving agreement of opinion. Men’s decisions are worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to the displayed agreement being misinterpreted as a signal of compatibility. The study ultimately stresses that designs intended for women, and at-risk groups more broadly, must also be assessed with other user demographics—namely those that pose a risk--to identify unforeseen implications.",

      "abstract": "An understanding of medical diagnosis as it is practiced is essential for those seeking to support it using intelligent systems. Through the case of epilepsy, we show that diagnosis is a situated, relational, and evolving process that accounts for information well beyond the patient's physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. Through observations and interviews with neurologists, we show that the meaning of brainwaves and other physiological data depends upon a range of patient-specific and contextual factors, such as age, comorbidities, and mealtimes. Further, we show that diagnosis is partly determined by social factors such as the activities of caregivers and other clinicians, and environmental factors such as faulty electrical wiring. Additionally, diagnostic classifications can evolve in response to new information: events that were once considered seizures can be reinterpreted as clinically irrelevant and vice versa. We contribute a broader sociotechnical perspective to literature on intelligent decision making in healthcare and discuss implications for the design of decision support systems that can better support the work of medical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Prior studies of technology non-use demonstrate the need for approaches that go beyond a simple binary distinction between users and non-users. This paper proposes a set of two different methods by which researchers can identify types of non/use relevant to the particular sociotechnical settings they are studying. These methods are demonstrated by applying them to survey data about Facebook non/use. The results demonstrate that the different methods proposed here identify fairly comparable types of non/use. They also illustrate how the two methods make different trade offs between the granularity of the resulting typology and the total sample size. The paper also demonstrates how the different typologies resulting from these methods can be used in predictive modeling, allowing for the two methods to corroborate or disconfirm results from one another. The discussion considers implications and applications of these methods, both for research on technology non/use and for studying social computing more broadly.",

      "abstract": "Recent CSCW research on the collaborative design and development of research infrastructures for the natural sciences has increasingly focused on the challenges of open data sharing. This qualitative study describes and analyzes how multidisciplinary, geographically distributed ocean scientists are integrating highly diverse data as part of an effort to develop a new research infrastructure to advance science. This paper identifies different kinds of coordination that are necessary to align processes of data collection, production, and analysis. Some of the hard work to integrate data is undertaken before data integration can even become a technical problem. After data integration becomes a technical problem, social and organizational means continue to be critical for resolving differences in assumptions, methods, practices, and priorities. This work calls attention to the diversity of coordinative, social, and organizational practices and concerns that are needed to integrate data and also how, in highly innovative work, the process of integrating data also helps to define scientific problem spaces themselves.
