      "abstract": "The games Horror Laboratory and Horror Cabin were designed to investigate ethic issues of virtual reality (VR), however, the presented work focuses on their technical implementation. Each game runs on desktop computer (PC), VR, and extended VR, namely smart substitutional reality (SSR). SSR describes the integration of smart home devices into VR as well as matching the real and virtual environment. Thereby it enriches the games by adding sensory stimuli. A study was conducted to, inter alia, compare the effects of the games' presentation on the perceived presence and the induced emotions. Also, effects of desensitization were examined. Selected results show higher spatial presence for VR and SSR compared to the PC condition. There were no differences regarding the users' emotional experience nor regarding desensitization effects. Further analysis will be part of future work.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity or exercise can improve people's health and reduce their risk of developing several diseases; most importantly, regular activity can improve the quality of life. However, lack of time is one of the major barriers for people doing exercise. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can reduce the time required for a healthy exercise regime but also bring similar benefits of regular exercise. We present a boxing-based VR exergame called VirusBoxing to promote physical activity for players. VirusBoxing provides players with a platform for HIIT and empowers them with additional abilities to jab a distant object without the need to aim at it precisely. In this paper, we discuss how we adapted the HIIT protocol and gameplay features to empower players in a VR exergame to give players an efficient, effective, and enjoyable exercise experience.",

      "abstract": "Breathing exercise games are designed to increase motivation and adherence during the rehabilitation of respiratory conditions such as pneumonia. However, current breathing exercise game designs rely upon custom built and/or non-commodity hardware that can be relatively expensive, require regular upkeep, and are complex. Together the issues associated with the breath sensing technology in many current breathing games act as a barrier to their accessibility and design. To address these limitations, we designed and built Bubble Breather, a game that uses the microphone and speakers available in commodity devices (e.g., phones and laptops) to sense breathing using ultrasound. Bubble Breather was designed specifically to use this newer type of breath sensing in two commonly prescribed breathing exercises for pneumonia: Breath Stacking and Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Therapy. We present the design and implementation of Bubble Breather, and describe our future work to iteratively extend and improve the game through co-design sessions with clinicians and patients.",

      "abstract": "In virtual environments, users can move almost infinitely while actually staying within a small area in real space. Several techniques such as Infinite Walking and Redirected Walking have already been developed for this purpose, but in order to overcome their respective limitations, several of them must be combined with visual effects and tricks to create the impression of a realistic environment and realistic movement. In this paper, our graduation class presents the prototype of a shopping mall simulator game realizing infinite motion in 3D on 639 m² within a 5 x 5 meter VR sensor range, even allowing the player to move freely on multiple floors of a beautifully designed shopping mall.",

      "abstract": "After a stroke, it is common to experience weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, including difficulty incorporating an affected upper extremity in activities of daily living. Virtual reality and video games that encourage task-oriented movement have been recognized as a valid clinical approach for providing stroke survivors with additional therapy. However, there have been few, if any, reports that examine the use of immersive virtual reality in the home for this purpose. Here, we describe a case study of a stroke survivor utilizing a therapeutic gaming system in the home over the course of several months. The digital therapeutic, CogniviveVR, utilizes head-mounted display-based virtual reality to provide patients with an immersive world where therapeutic tasks can be generated and dynamically self-adapted within a patient’s peripersonal space. The therapy was found to be feasible, well-tolerated, and engaging, with the study participant self-administering therapy approximately half an hour per day, 5-6 times a week over the course of eight weeks. Analysis of 3D motion data collected during sessions showed significant improvements in movement smoothness during performance of game tasks. After this pilot study, the system was successfully adapted to run on a stand-alone virtual reality headset. This has substantially reduced system setup requirements and will enable additional home-based studies to be conducted without the need for a study staff member to visit patients’ homes to verify installation.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we study the possibility of influencing player performance in Tetris by varying the tempo of the music. To keep a player in the flow, it is useful to be able to vary the difficulty of a game. It has been shown that music influences human behavior and cognition (memory, reflexes). By synchronizing or desynchronizing the tempo with the fall of the tetriminos and varying the tempo in steps or more gradually, we found that a synchronous and steadily increasing tempo makes the game difficult for novice players and even more so for those with a neutral evaluation of the music. We also discovered that the tempo setting in one session can positively or negatively prepare the performance in the next session for all the players. These results pave the way for the creation of an AI capable of varying the difficulty of a game through music.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how different players experience gameplay is of vital importance in game development to ensure that the games are enjoyable and rewarding for a diverse audience. Since each user research method has its own strengths and weaknesses, one of the key questions for user researchers is to determine which methods to use in their study design. In this paper we studied the severity of first-person shooter game issues identified using Electrodermal activity based biometrics in comparison to observation and in relation to the type of issues. Our results provide an understanding and a supporting argument about the importance of severity from a player's perspective. This incremental work provides an important contribution to the Games User Research field by aiding data-driven decision making during the game evaluation process. ",

      "abstract": "The aim of our study is to test an experimental framework for studying the efficacy of gamified interventions for chronic pain patients. Similar to pain perception, game playing is a subjective experience, and therefore, to design efficacious game-therapies, one must account for inter-individual differences in playing preference that may predict the analgesic experience. We deployed an experimental framework for studying the relation between subjective appraisal of games, and experimental pain perception in healthy young adults (N=4, 1 male, all 21 years of age) under three conditions: playing their preferred, non-preferred, and a digital working-memory test, while undergoing a calibrated pain experiment. In three participants, playing a preferred game was more effective in reducing sensation of pain, compared to a pain-reducing cognitive task. Our results illustrate that qualitative differences in game appraisal translate to quantitative differences in pain perception. We describe the application of our experimental framework in developing personalized digital medicine for coping with chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging movement data to support children’s learning is appealing and technically challenging. However, there is limited knowledge about exploiting the complete design potential of bodily interplay in learning games. We conducted an in-the-wild study with 8 children, with special educational needs, playing a language based educational motion-based touchless game. We collected children’s interaction data (correctness and reaction time), and data regarding the different design elements (game settings) implemented in 90 game sessions. Our analysis shows that number of items on-screen, selection gestures, and time to select items, impact the effectiveness (correctness) and efficiency (reaction time) of the children. We highlight the value of interaction analytics and quantify the relationship between different game design elements and children’s efficiency and effectiveness. Our findings help shape the future of  learning research by emphasising the substantial benefits of collecting movement data during children’s interaction with learning games.",

      "abstract": "Kids who can easily collaborate with their peers are often up to a great start in their adult life. For effective collaboration, the collaborating individuals must be empathetic enough to be able to understand each other well and resolve conflicts as and when they arise. However, such abstract concepts are difficult to teach in classrooms since they do not always adhere to the boundaries that theoretical definitions place on them. A much better way to explain such concepts lies in practicing them, and one of the key ways in which these skills can be practiced and taught in classrooms is through games. Games serve as an excellent learning tool since they make learning fun and help students pay attention and stay focused on the subject. For this reason, we have designed and developed a novel dual-player game called \"Two Shapes\" that makes use of its in-game mechanics as a tool to teach children the essential skills of collaboration and empathy. The game has been designed in such a way that the two players are required to recognize each other's strengths and abilities to overcome obstacles in their paths by leveraging them.",

      "abstract": "Archipelago is a single-player point-and-click narrative adventure game served to the player in bite-sized, three-minute-long daily levels.\r\nIt is a \"cyclical adventure game\", like a year-long advent calendar: each real-world calendar day has its own unique level, the game does not begin or end on any specific level, and players can return to levels year after year to uncover more of their secrets. The world of Archipelago can be explored for many years.\r\nArchipelago attempts to form an under-explored (and perhaps new) type of long-term relationship between videogames and their players, a relationship that bridges two very different approaches to what gaming is: gaming as the appreciation of cultural artifacts (games as products you consume) and gaming as a habitual, ritualistic activity (gaming as a hobby, something you do).\r\nTo pursue such a far-reaching goal, Archipelago takes its inspiration from two main sources. First is the “Daily Challenge” and seasonal content model of contemporary free-to-play games, which Archipelago attempts to turn into the core gameplay and narrative loop, instead of their usual place as secondary mechanics. Second is Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1986 “Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction”. Archipelago is an attempt to apply Le Guin’s ideas to the medium of videogames.\r\nThe version submitted here is my Master's thesis project at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, featuring a week-long cycle and 7 levels. I am now working to expand it into a full game, with a year-long cycle of 365 levels.\r\nThe Archipelago thesis game tells the story of a traveler searching for a home in an island country, inspired by my experience leaving my birth country and immigrating to Denmark.\r\nThis paper includes edited excerpts from the full thesis report, originally delivered in June 2020.",

      "abstract": "Current explorations and classification systems of videogames struggle to accurately conceptualize non-traditional indie videogames and artgames, falling short of effectively capturing their often-nuanced approaches to both gameplay and narrative. In order to effectively examine the diverse approaches to narrative and gameplay embodied in indie games and artgames, this research explores the role of meaning-making within indie videogames and its connection to interactivity and player action. In order to investigate the process of meaning-making within indie videogames, this research aims to introduce the concept of ‘indie creatorship’ as a process at the nexus of player-videogame interaction and processes of narrative meaning-making. This concept will be quantified through a survey of player perception of interactions within indie videogames before being applied in practice to the development of four indie games. This project is expected to contribute both a novel framework for conceptualizing indie games, and a redefinition of the relationship between interaction and meaning-making within indie games.",

Concepts such as intrinsic motivation and need satisfaction inform discussion around topics including the nature of good player-computer interaction, the intersection of play and wellbeing, and designing interactive gamified systems that motivate sustained engagement. SDT-based measures index elements of player experience, facilitating evaluations of games and game-adjacent systems. Despite the widespread application of SDT at CHI PLAY, some central concepts and mini-theories receive only cursory attention; as such, a substantial degree of untapped potential remains within SDT for advancing player-computer interaction.

Unlike previous mobile AR applications that were limited to horizontal and vertical object placement, these game objects interact with real objects in the player’s environment with surface-level resolution. Features of the player’s environment provide kinematic constraints (on collision) and serve as obstructions both visually (occlusion) and during gameplay. Using single camera depth information, players can use familiar vector drawing tools to rapidly create and modify lines, rings, paths, and turns of domino tiles. We thereby provide a method for placing a plurality of gaming objects by converting raycasted anchor points into paths of game objects. This opens up novel possibilities of authoring tools specially adapted for AR game development or game-integrated level editing. ",

      "abstract": "As system infrastructures are becoming more secure against technical attacks, it is more difficult for attackers to overcome them with technical means. Social engineering instead exploits the human factor of information security and can have a significant impact on organizations. The lack of awareness about social engineering favors the successful realization of social engineering attacks, as employees do not recognize them as such early enough, resulting in high costs for the affected company. Current training approaches and awareness courses are limited in their versatility and create little motivation for employees to deal with the topic. The high immersion of virtual reality can improve learning in this context. We created The Social Engineer, an immersive educational game in virtual reality, to raise awareness and to sensitize players about social engineering. The player impersonates a penetration tester and conducts security audits in a virtually simulated company. The game consists of a detailed game world containing three distinct missions that require the player to apply different social engineering attack methods. Our concept enables the game to be highly extensible and flexible regarding different playable scenarios and settings. The Social Engineer can potentially benefit companies as an immersive self-training tool for their employees, support security experts in teaching social engineering awareness as part of a comprehensive training course, and entertain interested individuals by leveraging fun and innovative gameplay mechanics.",

We created Illuminate in response, a mobile game which leverages resource management and storytelling to instill grounded hope and inspire climate action for youth in Canadian classrooms through climate simulations. Illuminate tackles the under-explored topic of eco-grief from media in HCI and asks players to informatively invest in environmental strategies which reflect real life economic costs and environmental impacts in key Canadian contexts. This paper describes Illuminate’s conception to release and presents a game designed to motivate learning through meaningful simulations for grounded hope and action.",

Our questions are: \"Can a game help people maintain mental health and wellness in such a situation?\" and \"Will virtual escape from isolation in the game help people feel better in reality?\" Therefore, with the design concept of a \"healing game\", we developed Day- dream, a game that combines puzzles and interactive music-making experiences with the design concept of a \"healing game\" to help players slow down, relax, and imagine. In Daydream, players col- lect magic objects that can retrieve the main character’s memories and unfold her imagination, allowing players to enter a musical adventure. While this research project is still in the early stage, we conducted a preliminary user study and the feedbacks from the participant were generally positive to our design concept and game design. We believe such a design concept of a “healing game” would be promising as an interesting research topic in serious games.",

Our framework is based on interactive reinforcement learning (RL), and we used it to create a behavior authoring tool called MarioMix. This tool enables non-experts to create bots with varied playstyles for the game titled \\textit{Super Mario Bros.} The main interaction procedure of MarioMix consists of presenting short clips of gameplay displaying precomputed bots with different playstyles to end-users. Then, end-users can select the bot with the playstyle that behaves as intended. We evaluated MarioMix by incorporating input from game designers working in the industry.",

      "abstract": "As civil discourse in America is becoming less substantive and respectful (Doherty, 2019), some educators have turned to educational games as a potential solution. However, providing effective instruction on key civic skills (e.g., perspective taking) requires a level of individualization that is unscalable in traditional classroom environments. Here we present Persuasion Invasion, an educational game that uses Value-Adaptive Instruction to help students learn to engage in productive civil discourse (i.e., discourse that fosters democratic goals (Papacharissi, 2004)). Throughout the game, players learn about the values that underpin our beliefs and barriers to productive discourse (e.g., tribalism and bias). We tested a scalable, value-adaptive intervention, and found that we were able to estimate and, in some cases, reduce the impact of bias when reasoning about political arguments.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mood disorder that affects many people globally. One possible positive factor in the treatment of this disorder is support from relatives and friends of the affected person. However, the former can be helpless in aiding the depressed person due to a lack of awareness on the signs of depression and how it impacts their lives. It is in this context that \\textit{Equilibrium} was developed. \\textit{Equilibrium} is a serious narrative game that aims to raise awareness about depression and the importance of external help in the recovery process of those affected. It does so with a grounded narrative and accessible gameplay, in a format that is easily shareable.",

      "abstract": "Are you frustrated when a board game has too many rules? Do you want to jump straight into the game and just play? We created Curioscape, an escape room board game that focuses on the idea of whether eliminating a rule book is possible in a board game context. This means players can start the game without having to learn rules or understand how the game works. This paper describes Curioscape’s conception to release, along with the exploration of replicating escape rooms in a smaller space and investigates if we can use curiosity to create meaningful game design choices.",

Designers in the interactive entertainment industry create some of the most engaging and enriching experiences for media users. However, as someone who has worked in the industry, I find that designers do not have enough time to conduct research or reflect over their practice. There is not much research work done that focuses on improving the design expertise or maturity levels of the design thinking, practices, and processes framework. Academic research on the other hand focuses more on theory-building and studying the effects of media interaction. I find that there is a disconnect between designer-studio practices and academic research focus. I wish to bridge this gap through my research work with the objective of building theories grounded in practice. The outcome of my dissertation work will include design frameworks that foster enjoyable experiences for designers and game studios in terms of sustainable processes, designer engagement with the process and effectiveness of the design outcome.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a frequently used term - and has seen decades of use - in the video games industry. Yet, while academic AI research recently produced notable advances both in different methods and in real-world applications, the use of modern AI techniques, such as deep learning remains curiously sparse in commercial video games. Related work has shown that there is a notable separation between AI in games and academic AI, down to the level of the definitions of what AI is and means. To address the practical barriers that sustain this gap, we conducted a series of interviews with industry professionals.\r\nThe outcomes underline requirements that are often overlooked: While academic (games) AI research tends to focus on problem-solving capacity, industry professionals highlight the importance of ``usability aspects of AI'': the ability to produce plausible outputs (effectiveness), computational performance (efficiency) and ease of implementation (ease of use).",

Using vignettes from players’ gameplay, it discusses how players’ approaches to solving puzzles informed the iterative design of game mechanics of Hello New World, a videogame created to promote youth participation in cybersecurity. Preliminary findings suggest well- designed failure and feedback creates productive frustration that supports players in learning, whereas poorly designed feedback creates unproductive frustration which inhibits the gameplay and learning experience.",

Analysis confirms that self-rated skill can be effective for differentiating actual performance on average, but that it is not necessarily predictive for every game, and that while player performance is comparable across gender, few male participants self-rated at the lowest skill level, and no females self-rated at the highest. Additional findings suggest having participants self-rate on a five point scale, but applying those ratings in three tiers may be effective for differentiating game performance by player skill level across gender.

This case study examines the impact of a specific system, StoryCarnival, on one 3-year-old child’s engagement in sociodramatic play with his peers. Comparing this child’s participation in sessions using either StoryCarnival or a traditional intervention over eight weeks, StoryCarnival appeared to lower barriers to this child’s physical and verbal engagement in social play. Future research could identify whether this pattern may hold for other children who have trouble entering social play with peers.",

      "abstract": "Children's creativity plummets as they enter elementary school. Social interactions with peers and playful environments have been shown to foster creativity in children. Digital pedagogical tools often lack the creativity benefits of co-located social interaction with peers. In this work, we leverage a social embodied robot as a playful peer and designed Escape!Bot, a game involving child-robot co-play, where the robot is a social agent that scaffolds for creativity during gameplay. We aim to investigate the factorial extent to which the robot's embodiment (the co-presence of a peer-like social embodied agent), and scaffolding (the expression of creativity scaffolding behaviors by the social agent), influence children's creativity during gameplay. We contribute a novel social robotic interaction paradigm that aims to foster creative expression during gameplay.",

      "abstract": "Procedural content generation (PCG) has found itself in the spotlight within game development with games such as Minecraft~\\cite{minecraft}, No Man's Sky~\\cite{nomansky}, and Spelunky~\\cite{spelunky}, improving replayability, reducing the developers' workload, and fostering the designers' creativity~\\cite{shaker2016procedural,hastings_evolving_2009,Alvarez2018}. However, some type of narrative or context is required to make sense of the PCG content when implemented into the game space~\\cite{ashmore2007}. An example of narrative is objectives. If there is an objective within the content, for example, finding a sacred gem in a dangerous dungeon, then that creates interaction between the user and the content, which creates the needed context.\r\nThe Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) is a mixed-initiative design tool used for creating and generating dungeons \\cite{alvarexempowering}. This paper gathers the first step towards implementing a sub-system for EDD, which procedurally generates objectives for dungeons. The current sub-system gathers and continuously adapts to the designer's dungeon to place different objectives based on the rooms' content. Through this, the designer focuses on creating the dungeon while seamlessly, they are provided with the different generated objectives. We evaluate the artifact's utility, quality, and efficacy based on how well the objectives represent the layout of the dungeon with experimental scenarios. ",

      "abstract": "As tabletop games are ported to digital versions to increase their accessibility, the expected User Experience (UX) might be degraded in the transition. This paper aims to understand how and why playing tabletop games differentiates depending on the platform. Seven tabletop games have been chosen from different genres with an official digital adaptation. Our approach has been to do a comparative analysis of both versions followed by a user study to analyze and measure the UX differences, measuring five key factors, Usability, Engagement, Social Connectivity, Aesthetics, and Enjoyment. Our results indicate that games that rely on imperfect information offer a much higher social connectivity and engagement when played around a table. Meanwhile, games relying on tile-placement offers higher usability and engagement when played digitally due to the assistance provided by the game. However, the physical versions got, in general, a higher rating than the digital versions in all key factors except slightly in the usability. Physical versions are the preferred options, but the digital versions' benefits, such as accessibility and in-game assistance, makes them relevant for further analysis.",

Data from 18 users show world alteration does not totally overcome network latency, but improves performance and quality of experience over an uncompensated game.",

We report on the design of the tool and on a preliminary user study conducted with six participants to assess acceptance and usefulness of the tool.

      "abstract": "Facilitating discussions with children and young adults on problems associated with climate change can be difficult. Fostering actionable approaches to these problems comes with even more challenges. One such avenue of exposure to sustainable messages is through the use of serious games. In recent years, serious games have become a popular medium for developing behavior change. Planet Bug is an educational game that utilizes tactics of serious gameplay to teach players about insects and their declining populations. The issue of declining insect populations in particular has received little media coverage or publicity. Planet Bug immerses players in a narrative story that provokes thoughts on conservation and awareness of insects, while providing a unique and interactive gaming experience. To further develop the impact of Planet Bug on the greater scientific community, future developments of the game could focus on creating actionable items outside of gameplay, such as collecting insects in one’s real-life environment. Current initiatives from entomologists involving the public could both inspire and guide the future direction of gameplay for Planet Bug.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we report on three projects in which we are applying natural language processing techniques to analyse video game reviews. We present our process, techniques, and progress for extracting and analysing player reviews from the gaming platform Steam. Analysing video game reviews presents great opportunity to assist players to choose games to buy, to help developers to improve their games, and to aid researchers in further understanding player experience in video games. With limited previous research that specifically focuses on game reviews, we aim to provide a baseline for future research to tackle some of the key challenges. Our work shows promise for using natural language processing techniques to automatically identify features, sentiment, and spam in video game reviews on the Steam platform.",

      "abstract": "We present a pilot study on \\textit{crea.blender}, a novel co-creative game designed for large-scale, systematic assessment of distinct constructs of human creativity. Co-creative systems are systems in which humans and computers (often with Machine Learning) collaborate on a creative task. This human-computer collaboration raises questions about the relevance and level of human creativity and involvement in the process. We expand on, and explore aspects of these questions in this pilot study. We observe participants play through three different play modes in \\textit{crea.blender}, each aligned with established creativity assessment methods. In these modes, players “blend” existing images into new images under varying constraints. Our study indicates that crea.blender provides a playful experience, affords players a sense of control over the interface, and elicits different types of player behavior, supporting further study of the tool for use in a scalable, playful, creativity assessment.

      "abstract": "Cognitive biases affect the choices we make and affect selection processes. Biased hiring processes affect the quality of hires by valuing salient features such as age or skin colour over the quality of an applicant. Hence, there is a need for unobtrusive trainings to combat cognitive biases. Video games are a promising avenue to reduce cognitive biases, because they allow to engage and train in cognitive challenges. To address attention biases, and bias to focus on most salient features (salience bias) specifically, we built LOOk, a first-person game that requires attention to detail. We investigated if the attentional activation of playing LOOk transferred to a custom built hiring task, the Photo test. Our results suggest that there are no transfer effects after playing LOOk. We find variance in replies to the Photo test, suggesting potential of the test, but no effects of the game intervention. The lack of results raises questions about how to design game play as an intervention for cognitive biases.",

      "abstract": "Stress regulation through relaxation techniques have been long practiced through various kinds of breathing exercises. It is often observed that sedentary jobs with high cognitive load are not just stressful but also leave individuals with very little time to practice relaxation. For busy individuals even short sessions of conscious deep breathing have been found to be very effective in releasing stress. Breathing exercise-based games often enable individuals to engage in short fun sessions of relaxation. These games if mobile based, can be accessed anywhere and at any time. In this paper we present the conceptualization and design of the game ‘Calm: Blow away your Stress’. The game enables players to relax through deep-breathing controlled gameplay. The game is designed with a unique biofeedback mechanism using inbuilt mobile sensor which enables players to effectively execute the deep breathing exercise.  ",

Recently, the Player Experience Inventory (PXI) was presented, a validated 30-item survey instrument using a 7-point Likert scale. The issue with this instrument is that with 30 items it is too long for research studies for which PX is one of the measures. We present in this work-in-progress paper the mPXI or the mini Player Experience Inventory, a 10-item survey instrument. We evaluated the mPXI with an educational game used in engineering education (n = 169). While further evaluation of the mPXI is needed, the current results show promise for using a shortened version of the original PXI. ",

      "abstract": "Games and game-like methodologies are increasingly used as research environments, especially to conduct experiments to study decision-making. This growing trend in conducting gamified experiments is suggestive of the need for pilot studies and pre-testing the underlying games as well as experimental design. In this paper, we present an example of conducting a pilot study using Gamettes, a game-based methodology for collecting rich behavioral data on human decisions. Our results shed light on the efficacy of our experiment, how Gamettes' players interact with it in the way it is designed, and help identify issues that could bias the experiment and lead to a failed study. They further confirm the importance of conducting and reporting such pilot studies in gamified research.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a promising approach in treating phobias such as fear of heights (acrophobia). VRET provides an effective, cost-efficient, scalable and individually adaptable alternative to traditional exposure therapy. To further foster the potential of VRET, a novel concept called Playful User-generated Treatment (PUT) was derived from expert interviews and literature review. In this paper, we provide additional insights regarding the applicability of PUT in real therapy scenarios. For that purpose, practicing psychotherapists (n=13) participated in an online survey and shared their assessments regarding PUT. By conducting qualitative content analysis (inductive category formation), we identified opportunities and challenges that should be considered for the design of playful VRET systems. Opportunities were seen for preparatory habituation, increased control and self-efficacy, improved interaction, economic usage and a realistic display of anxiety-inducing environments. Challenges included lack of direct communication and realism as well as pseudo-habituation to virtual environments.",

      "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) games and applications require accurate spatial positioning of the head-mounted display (HMD) within the virtual environment. Inside-out tracking technologies such as “Oculus Insight” derive the HMD position by tracking “landmarks” in the user’s environment. Because these technologies face specific limitations in deriving the HMD position and rotation, players can experience noticeable spatial drift[1]. To develop a better understanding of these limitations and improve tracking accuracy, we tested “Oculus Insight” under several environmental and user conditions. We used Unreal Engine to develop a calibration program which measures the discrepancy between the HMD’s real-world and its in-game positions, in order to calculate the relative spatial drift. We replicated this program in several environments, duration and distance travelled by a user. Preliminary findings suggest methods for improving spatial accuracy over time; most notably providing a white grid pattern against dark carpet, which improved tracking by a factor of 4.3. This study helps researchers and practitioners minimize spatial drift in VR optical tracking systems such as Oculus Insight. ",

      "abstract": "In order to understand a pandemic like the COVID-19 crisis of 2020, we have to keep in mind larger patterns (e.g., information visualizations such as charts), and individual perspectives (e.g., interviews). However, it is challenging to connect these larger patterns with lived experiences. In this work-in-progress paper, we argue that interactive digital experiences such as games have the potential to bridge this gap by allowing players to explore the pandemic at multiple levels of abstraction. We present Essential Workers: an online multiplayer game which situates players as one of four workers–Nurse, Grocery Worker, Office Worker, or Delivery Driver–who face difficult dilemmas as they live through three weeks of rising infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a core cooperative game mechanic, Essential Workers seeks to tie the constraints and choices of the individual to the health of their communities, and to simulate some of the interdependencies that keep our communities functional during the pandemic. We aim to illustrate our approach to key challenges commonly faced by designers seeking to model the entanglements of the individual and society.",

      "abstract": "Even though virtual reality (VR) shares features with video games, it offers a wider range of experiences. There is currently no cohesive classification for commercial VR offerings. As a first step to account for this deficiency, the work in progress considers the relationship between game genres and users’ ratings and downloads of VR experiences. We found Action, Shooter, and Simulation to be the most frequently downloaded genres; Action and Music/Rhythm the most highly rated; and Simulation and Music/Rhythm to occur at a statistically higher rate in VR compared to non-VR. Finally, we learned that VR experiences are less likely to receive positive ratings than 2D games. The findings can inform developers’ marketing decisions based on demand.",

      "abstract": "The excessive consumption of free sugars – sugar added to food, drinks and existing in honey, syrup and fruit juice – are endemic to the diets of Western children and a leading factor in dental disease. Recent public health interventions and legislation have aimed to safeguard consumer health. However, children and their parents continue to face challenges in understanding the implications of product sugar content for their long-term dental health when weighed against contradictory nutritional benefits and child-friendly marketing.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon previous HCI research on serious play for nutritional awareness and leveraging the power of digital pets for enacting behaviour change, we introduce ‘the Sugargotchi’ – an embodied digital companion to raise children’s awareness of their dental health and the adverse impacts of free sugars. This paper describes the rationale for the Sugargotchi’s development, an overview of our initial prototype, and highlights the key design challenges it faces for household and clinical adoption.\r\n",

      "abstract": "A high prevalence of \"acute pain\" within hospital emergency departments and side-effects of current practices calls for new additional treatment measures. Alternatives to analgesics include Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) and Virtual Reality (VR). Whereas proven effectively separately, the combination AAT techniques and VR analgesia has received no or scant attention. In this paper we focus on exploring this field through exploring the literature from the separate approaches and show how they would fit together, conceptualized in a new VR application ANIM3. Leading in this development process, besides the extensive literature review, were stakeholder interviews. Our first user encounters gained positive responses to the prototype. As a whole, we see strong indications that \"acute pain\" reduction in the hospital based on AAT principles in Virtual Reality is a promising technique. We postulate that these experiences should add well timed heightened distractions, while keeping the contextual factors in mind leading to interactions of a maximum of about 15 mins, with limited or no need for explanations, and limit need of locomotion and two-hand controls. We recommend the creation of proposals to further development and research to explore these possibilities to their full potential.",

This paper draws on a 4-month participant observational study of game play and interest among active older women (aged 63-83, N=14). The results show how gender and age shape digital game interest and play among the participants. For them, being an older woman now means keeping up with the times, being active and helping others. They disregarded digital games that clashed with this identity. When the digital games projected their identity, their play was fun and productive; and led to recommending the games to others. Current and future research activities are outlined.",

However, people with impairments and disabilities may have difficulty performing a whole-body movement and manipulation of devices; therefore, their opportunities for coordinating behaviors are considerably reduced, especially in virtual environments. In this study, we focus on gaze interaction as a primary interaction method and investigate coordinating behaviors in a virtual environment. In addition, we implement a three vs. one ball possession game controlled using gaze interaction. As a preliminary study, we examine the coordinating behavioral patterns of game players without impairments and disabilities. Moreover, our experimental result demonstrates that it is possible to perform three vs. one ball possession games using gaze interaction. Further, we observe the distribution of angles among the three players, with modes at 56, 72, and 50 degrees for players 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This reveals the approximate shape of the triangle constructed by the players. In the real-world player's skill, the resulted triangle allowed us to categorize the players at the intermediate level.",

To create a sense of team spirit, we enabled players to talk to a multiplicity of agents using natural language. We hypothesize that conversing with only one agent cannot produce the same level of camaraderie. \r\nWe conducted a preliminary qualitative user study (N=10) to explore how players experience talking with the in-game characters in the single-agent and the multi-agent condition.

      "abstract": "Bullying can have various negative short and long-term consequences for adolescents. With online technology expanding the occasions for bullying, developing solutions to prevent bullying and cyberbullying has become even more pressing. We have developed two prototypes of educational games to raise awareness of the consequences of bullying among adolescents by putting them into the role of a bystander. The two games differed in the form of gameplay: one allowed for explorative play while the other used a linear narrative. We report on first results obtained by evaluating both games in classrooms and reflect on how integrating such games into a classroom context can be beneficial.  ",

We start by exploring the effectiveness of pairing players based on personality types and simple game features such as competitive and cooperative group challenges. We present initial findings of a 60-day study showing that matching players based on similar personalities can increase the level of game enjoyment and retention compared to dissimilar ones. Insights into designing and researching other personal characteristics for improving player matching mechanisms and increasing retention are on the agenda for a larger study.",

      "abstract": "Social robots are becoming increasingly common in the contexts of education and healthcare. This paper reports on the findings of the first stage of an exploratory study conducted with (n=16) Finnish preschoolers aged 5-7 years. The multidisciplinary study intertwining the areas of early education pedagogics, smart toys and interactive technologies, employed both a commercial robot dog and a real dog to study the potential of these artificial and living entities to support and facilitate social-emotional learning (SEL) through a guided playful learning approach. We performed a research intervention including facilitation, observation and video- recordings of three play sessions organized in March-May 2020. The preliminary findings indicate how guided playing with the robot dog supported SEL through conversation about human relationships, while interaction with the real dog facilitated empathic responses through spontaneous reactions on the animal’s behavior. The contribution of our research is an understanding of that a robotic dog more than a living dog may assist in simulating human interaction more than human- animal interaction and is in this way suitable to support playful learning of social-emotional competencies.",

Despite these benefits, study participants report numerous barriers to shared recreation with loved ones.  Among others, these include differences in recreational preferences and safety measures associated with the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this paper we examine how loved ones use, and wish to use, technology to play together while apart.  We take into account reported barriers to shared recreation and present the Planet Runner technology probe, a two-player digital-physical game which mediates a shared interdependent asymmetric recreational experience involving the outdoors. We share early findings from an exploratory study and conclude by highlighting design considerations for asymmetric games intended to mediate shared remote play experiences involving the outdoors.",

Based on our initial experience in two small user tests, we assume that the VR version induces a social experience similar to the co-located gameplay. We will test this assumption in subsequent user studies.\r\nWe also outline the theoretical and methodological relevance of VR-simulated couch-coop multiplayer games for researchers and practitioners.

Our work extends the Otherworld Framework (OF) [7] for tangible tools by centering specifically on play as a conversation topic. Here we unpack how early experiments with OF motivated our work and describe the current iteration of the MESMER tool, which comprises persona cards, various boards, and a shared physical token. MESMER is inspired by our findings from early trials with OF: performative playful interaction promoted playful and divergent thinking; embodied non-verbal communication led to shared insights, the board’s contents and structure helped scaffold conversations, a diversity of personas and narratives seemed desirable, and role-playing personas encouraged multi-stakeholder empathy. Our ongoing research aims to help designers and researchers to facilitate engaging, fruitful and inspiring conversations where diverse stakeholders can contribute to playful technology design.",

However, for people with mobility impairment, exercise facilities can also be hard to access, increasing the importance of exercising at home. In this work, we explore the potential of hypercasual exergames - games that drastically reduce the amount of setup time - to provide opportunities for physically active and playful breaks throughout the day. Modifying an existing exergame geared toward wheelchair users, we report results from a player experience evaluation with eight wheelchair users that suggest a positive user experience, and outline how we seek to further develop the idea of hypercasuality of playful exertion in the future.",

      "abstract": "This document introduces the learning approach and projected outcomes of the author's ongoing PhD research, which aims to deliver guidelines for the use of game-based learning techniques, with game making at its core, in chemical engineering education. Since making games requires some technical knowledge that chemical engineering students do not usually possess, the author is developing a custom-made editor to make games intuitively without needing programming skills. Additionally, a game design workshop is included in the learning experience to ease the difficulties of beginners when creating games. All in all, the strategy facilitates hands on sessions that extend traditional education, during which chemical engineering content is approached differently than in a conventional class. Students work in teams, embrace a constructivist learning approach to create an educational game and participate in a hackathon-like event (game jam) to mention some of the features included in this learning experience.",

      "abstract": "Science museums are often interactive spaces where a variety of visitors engage with exhibits in diverse ways. While trying to support participants’ behavior in ways that make intuitive sense for these behaviors in a museum context, these exhibits need to support interests and participation in forms that are meaningfully diverse – to make domains accessible to learners belonging to groups minoritized in those domains. In this paper, we present an interactive computational thinking exhibit designed to foster a multiplicity of goals and participatory behaviors. We also present preliminary analysis on how we can use play data to delineate the pursuit of different goals mediated through different pursuits. We also find care to be a uniquely valuable aesthetic motivator in gameplay, often overlooked in common design frameworks – with potential to expand perspectives on computing and combat inequity among computing learners.

      "abstract": "In shared virtual reality (VR) spaces, users can appear and disappear without transitions, in a pop-in, pop-out style. This solution to entry and exit might be an acceptable solution for certain settings, but produces uncertainty in more intimate settings. Our research explores alternate entry and exit paradigms for shared VR spaces. Based on anthropological studies of entry and exit rituals in physical homes, we created a user journey map for entry and exit that differentiates the roles of host and guest in the shared VR space. We iteratively developed Unity prototypes that allowed a ``host'' to invite a ``guest'' into their virtual space, engage them in simple interactions, and invite the guest to depart. We define exvitation as a critical stage in the guest's departure--a social permission for a guest to depart the host's home. We identify exvitation prompts that were salient to our users and report of how these prompts were received by participants in our playtests. Future work on our user journey map as well as our exvitation prompts can aid in the expansion of playful experiences possible in VR.",

      "abstract": "As more viewers become interested in watching authentic personalities as opposed to artificial, crafted performances, Twitch streamers have begun to discuss personal issues such as mental health to form a closer bond with their community. This paper seeks to further explore how a live streamer's choice in game affects their viewers' perception of their stream's content. We interviewed 24 Twitch viewers and found that the pace of the game a streamer chooses to stream is a key factor in what viewers expect to see during the stream. These expectations at least partially determine whether viewers want to hear conversations about mental health. ",

Our research focuses on designing and evaluating interactive spectator experiences. This paper describes the initial stages of our current project on developing a spectator-specific user typology that aims to help developers better understand their target audience. Here we report on the development of a survey and pilot study based on a popular typology for users of gamified apps. Our initial result highlights several hints of possible trends in spectators’ interaction preference depending on their user type. Using these findings, our immediate next step is to design and conduct a study to validate the observed trends and study the correlation between spectators’ user type with interactive livestreaming features.

VR serious games are increasingly used in training and evacuation preparedness for natural hazards. Understanding players' behavior is critical to improving the experience of these VR serious games. Incorporating narrative in SG has proven to make them more effective; however, its influence on mediated presence and players' behavioral response is not studied extensively.  This preliminary study investigates digital narratives' role on mediated presence, cognitive behavior, and engagement in an evacuation training VR serious game. Participants (N=32) were exposed to virtual flooding in a virtual environment designed for evacuation training with and without a serious storytelling context. Quantitative analysis of players' experience revealed that VR implemented with digital narrative improved the sense of mediated presence and players' behavioral response.",

      "abstract": "While smart home devices are spreading rapidly, the privacy and security of users are key concerns. Many users struggle in acquiring and applying security recommendations to protect against malicious behavior in smart home systems, which can cause users to lose interest in this topic. Game-based learning is a powerful practice to increase the motivation of users in an entertaining and intuitive way. In this paper, we explore the effect of game premise on user's motivation and performance in an educational game. We designed a game with the aim to enlighten users about smart home security challenges. We developed two versions of the game with opposing game premises, a good and an evil, and compared them in a between-group experiment. The results show high motivation ratings in both versions of the game towards solving smart home security problems. However, there are no significant differences between the opposing game premises.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a significant driver of one’s wellbeing and an imbalance in daily stress can lead to severe mental health issues. Hence, timely management of stress is not only desirable but extremely crucial. In the realm of stress management, non-pharmacological methods are widely used. These methods generally consist of psychotherapy, behavior therapy and alternative therapies, to name a few of the major types of stress management interventions. Alternate therapies like yoga, meditation, art therapy etc. have shown to be effective and engaging in recent research. Playing games has also shown immense mental health benefits by effects such as dopamine release during game play, thus decreasing stress levels. In this paper, we look at the psychological stress relief technique of art therapy and the stress relief mechanisms and interactions in certain games. Taking inputs from the two, we discuss the conceptualization, design and initial findings of a stress relief game, Color Me.  ",

Drawing upon inspiration from sound effect synthesizers and description languages, Squeezer can \"synthesize\" common types of juice effects, by combining simple effects into effect sequences. These effect sequences can be edited and executed even while playing the game in the editor, lowering iteration times and easing the exploration of effects. We make a preliminary usability test to verify the functionality and scope of the tool. Squeezer is available at: https://github.com/pyjamads/Squeezer",

We present a design exploration of MathMythos AR, an augmented reality card-based math addition game that enables children to engage in basic math tasks embedded in fantastical narratives. We provide insights into our design process, the effects of fantasy and everyday narratives, and discuss implications for AR card games that show potential to foster motivation for learning math. The presented insights are the foundation for the the next iteration of MathMythos AR, where we aim to create compelling and immersive AR narratives for learning. ",

      "abstract": "In early 2020, the virus SARS-CoV-2 evolved into a new pandemic, forcing governments worldwide to establish social distancing measures. Consequently, people had to switch to online media, such as social networks or videotelephony, to keep in touch with friends and family. In this context, online games, combining entertainment with social interactions, also experienced a notable growth. In our work, we focused on the potential of games as a replacement for social contacts in the COVID-19 crisis. Our online survey results indicate that the value of games for social needs depends on individual gaming habits. Participants playing mostly multiplayer games increased their playtime and mentioned social play as a key motivator. Contrarily, non-players were not motivated to add games as communication channels. We deduce that such crises mainly catalyze existing gaming habits.",

Findings from GoPro video data reveal that different modalities (e.g., iPad app - Blockly, Dash robot, tape, physical path) within the activity enabled youth to consider and reconsider different approaches using their gestures before making up their mind. In conclusion, we emphasized that the examination of complex contexts in which participants learn and enact mathematical play requires attending to the embodied nature of failure and feedback. ",

      "abstract": "To democratize the power of games for smart cities, we are refining Hive Mechanic, an open-source game engine for embedding play with text messages, city data streams, and the Internet of Things (IoT). City-specific games have the potential to affect social issues, including to address regional economics and health disparities that vary by zip code. However, collaboration in design is notoriously difficult – and programming skills are often lacking in urban planners, artists, and ordinary residents. Rather than propose a consumer app for mobile phones, this project investigates the potential of coordinating play from a neighborhood server.  More importantly, the authoring tool seeks to democratize design by aligning the use of print and digital \"cards\" in the design process to express feedback loops and interactive sequences without requiring any traditional software coding experience. We argue that for game design in particular, paper prototyping is especially important – and that authoring tools can expand participation by embracing a \"card metaphor\" to extend the power of paper prototyping into online authoring tools. This work in progress is a nine-month case study of using Hive Mechanic, including for public art, crowd-sourced mapping, and a transmedia scavenger hunt.",

Unfortunately, another loyal companion is toxic player behavior, which can ruin a game even before the winner is decided. Yet what happens when opponents suddenly face a much more dangerous, common enemy in the form of a pandemic outbreak? Does such a situation act as common ground, uniting the players and increasing their social awareness? Or do players abuse the game (and other players) even more to release their frustration caused by the pandemic? The results of our ongoing work support the latter hypothesis: in most competitive games, players perceive a notable increase of toxicity, which is an alarming sign and a clear call for more detailed explorations.",

      "abstract": "Digital games are often created with large virtual worlds and a high number of degrees of freedom for players. For analyzing patterns of play, it is imperative to consider all features affecting the gameplay, which leads to an explosion in data space. To address this problem, we propose an approach for knowledge-based data abstraction -- inspired by applications in medicine -- that uses interactive visualizations based on game telemetry data to study player patterns. The approach involves iterative knowledge-based abstraction of elements of player action sequences to condense the data space to a level interpretable by game designers and user researchers. We developed this approach as part of developing a puzzle game using an existing interactive visualization tool, and demonstrate its value for understanding this game's player patterns. Based on the lessons learned from this study, we present a general set of guidelines for knowledge-based data abstraction for other game genres and interactive visualization systems.",

This lack of awareness influences our food related decisions and we end up following non-sustainable food practices. To create awareness on food related issues, we present two playful dining experiences: (1) Caesar on a Skewer that presents the hidden data about water consumption levels for different foods through a Caesar salad, and (2) Chopstick Parfait that visualizes the hidden data related to the food distribution channels through the Parfait dessert. We simulated the dining environment to evaluate these dining experiences. We present findings related to both dining play interactions and edible visualizations. To guide future technological development around food related issues, we discuss the implications of our work around three themes: food arrangement, playful discomforts and delayed feedback. Through this work, we aim to advocate and inspire the use of food for designing multi-sensorial serious play.  \r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "Statistical Significance Testing -- or Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) -- is common to quantitative CHI PLAY research. Drawing from recent work in HCI and psychology promoting transparent statistics and the reduction of questionable research practices, we systematically review the reporting quality of 119 CHI PLAY papers using NHST (data and analysis plan at OSF.io). We find that over half of these papers employ NHST without specific statistical hypotheses or research questions, which may risk the proliferation of false positive findings. Moreover, we observe inconsistencies in the reporting of sample sizes and statistical tests. These issues reflect fundamental incompatibilities between NHST and the frequently exploratory work common to CHI PLAY. We discuss the complementary roles of exploratory and confirmatory research, and provide a template for more transparent research and reporting practices. ",

      "abstract": "We propose 3PP-R, a novel Virtual Reality display and interaction technique that allows natural movement in 3rd-person perspective (3PP), including body rotation without losing sight of the avatar. A virtual display such as a World-in-Miniature model orbits around the user when the user turns, but does not rotate except for the user's avatar. From the user's perspective, the display appears fixed in the field of vision, while the world rotates around the avatar.  3PP-R combines the strengths of 3PP and 1st-person perspective (1PP): Similar to 1PP, it allows interacting with rich natural movements, while also reaping the benefits of 3PP, i.e., superior spatial awareness and animating the avatar without nauseating viewpoint movement, e.g., for joystick-controlled locomotion. We test 3PP-R in a maze navigation study, which indicates considerably less cybersickness in 3PP-R than in 1PP. We also demonstrate 3PP-R in dynamic game interaction including running, jumping, swinging on bars, and martial arts.",

      "abstract": "Game atmosphere and game audio are critical factors linked to the commercial success of video games. However, game atmosphere has been neither operationalized nor clearly defined in games user research literature, making it difficult to study. We define game atmosphere as the emerging subjective experience of a player caused by the strong audiovisual thematic cohesion (i.e., the harmonic fit of sounds and graphics to a shared theme) of video game elements. We studied players' experience of thematic cohesion in two between-subjects, independent-measures experiments (N=109) across four conditions differing in their level of audiovisual thematic fit. Participants' experiences were assessed with physiological and psychometric measurements to understand the effect of game atmosphere on player experience. Results indicate that a lack of thematic fit between audio and visuals lowers the degree of perceived atmosphere, but that while audiovisual thematic dissonance may lead to higher-intensity negative-valence facial events, it does not impact self-reported player experience or immersion.",

      "abstract": "Can intelligent non-player game characters (NPCs) increase children's  creativity during collaborative gameplay? Children's creativity is influenced by collaborative play with creative peers through social emulation. In this paper, we study children's emulation of an AI-enabled social Non-Player Character (NPC) as a new type of game mechanism to elicit creative expression. We developed Magic Draw, a collaborative drawing game designed to foster children's figural creativity that allows us to investigate the efficacy of an NPC's creativity demonstration in enhancing children's creativity in the resulting drawings. The NPC is an emotively expressive social robot that plays Magic Draw with a child as a peer-like playmate. We present the results of a study in which participants co-draw figures with a social robot that demonstrates different levels of figural creativity, to understand whether an NPC's creativity in its own contributions stimulates figural creativity in children. 78 participants (ages  5--10) were randomly assigned to a non-creative robot control condition (C-) and a creative robot condition (C+). Participants who interacted with the creative robot generated significantly more creative drawings, and hence exhibited higher levels of figural creativity. We infer that the social robotic peers' demonstration of figural creativity in a collaborative drawing game is emulated by young children. We discuss a new game design principle grounded in the social learning mechanism of emulation, specifically, that social and intelligent NPCs in games should demonstrate creative behavior to foster the same in human players.",

      "abstract": "Certain commercial games train spatial skills, a subset of cognitive skills used in school, the workplace, and everyday life. However, it is difficult to design spatial skill training games without knowing why some games are effective. In addition, existing game training studies do not analyze motivational factors for critical target populations. We conducted a study comparing spatial skill training effects and enjoyment for low spatial skill students on three training interventions: the computer game Homeworld Bound: Redux, digital spatial workbook exercises, and an active control group. We found no training effects for any intervention, but performance in certain game levels predicted spatial skill, and low spatial skill students enjoyed the game more than the workbook exercises. We provide three design recommendations for spatial skill training games based on our findings: use asymmetry for object manipulation tasks, require explicit 2D to 3D representation translation, and employ time pressure for navigation tasks.",

      "abstract": "Agents are part of our daily lives. They are in the games we play and in our phones as personal assistants. As users develop relationships with these agents, one question is about how to cultivate those relationships. This study chose one design feature, customization, to understand whether it would affect user experiences and whether there are optimal number of choices users prefer.  This paper describes the results of two studies. The first, a small scale (N=15), preliminary study explored user preferences when customizing an on-screen, robot-like, virtual agent partner. The data includes eye-tracking, screen capture, and a post-survey. Findings from this study suggests that a robot's clothes (both top and bottom) are the most important for users to customize. Informed by the first study, a custom application was developed to test user preferences for the number of choices and attributes in a large scale online study (N = 343). Findings from the second study suggest that participants preferred at least 8 different attributes to customize and they showed no decrease in satisfaction with the most number of choices (i.e., 24) per attribute. These findings are different from previous studies on choice overload and contribute to further understanding of choices in games and digital spaces.  ",

      "abstract": "Games user research (GUR) is centered on ensuring games deliver the experience that their designers intended. GUR researchers frequently make use of playtesting to evaluate games. This often requires watching back hours of video footage after the session to ensure that they did not miss anything important. Analytics have been used to help improve this process, providing visualizations of the underlying gameplay data. Yet, many of these game analytics tools provide static visualizations which do not accurately capture the dynamic aspects of modern video games. To address this problem, we have created Echo, a tool that uses gameplay data to reconstruct the original session with in-game assets, instead of abstracting them away. Echo has been designed to help bridge the gap between static gameplay data representation and video footage, with the goal of providing the best of both. A user study revealed that participants found Echo less frustrating to use compared to videos for gameplay analysis and also ranked it higher for efficiency, among others. It revealed that participants felt less cognitive load when using Echo as well. Qualitative results were also promising as participants employed several distinct workflows while using Echo. We received numerous suggestions for building upon the current state of the tool, including support for multiple viewports, live annotations, and visible gameplay metrics.",

      "abstract": "Gamification researchers deem adolescents a particularly interesting audience for tailored gamification. However, empirical validation of popular player typologies and personality trait models thus far has been limited to adults. As adolescents exhibit complex behaviours that differ from older adults, these models may need adaptation. To that end, we collected a unique data set of Big Five Inventory and Hexad questionnaire answers in Dutch from 402 adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the Dutch forms of the BFI-10, BFI-44 and Hexad scales performed substandard when used with adolescents. Through exploratory factor analysis, we investigated underlying problems, and provide preliminary suggestions on how to improve measurements. In particular, we propose to simplify the Hexad model, and to reformulate specific items. With this study, we hope to contribute to the debate on how to improve the tailoring of interactive systems for adolescents.",

Based on a requirement analysis consisting of a literature review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and implemented the PUT concept as a two-step VR game design.\r\nTo validate our approach, we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with 31 non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception, and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both studies reveal that the PUT approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design and exposure therapy.",

      "abstract": "Substantial research has explored the experience of immersion in digital games, but it is unclear whether this phenomenon extends to other game genres such as board games. Immersion is a concept widely discussed in the board game community by both developers and players and yet there is relatively little research in the area. This paper presents a grounded theory analysis of board game players' online discussions of immersion. This data is augmented by interviews with five board game players describing their experiences of immersion. The resultant analysis highlights that board game players discuss immersion in terms of both engrossment in the challenge of the game, and submergence within the game world the board game creates. We also focus on elements of game play which players reported in helping and hindering their immersion; importantly these elements do not always come from the game itself. We conclude that board game immersion shares similarities with the literature on immersion in digital games, despite the lack of multimedia interaction.  ",

      "abstract": "Toxic behaviors in online gaming such as flaming and harassment have been gaining attention from the research community, yet little consensus has formed about what constitutes toxic behavior. Game developers usually maintain a classification system of toxic behaviors, which oftentimes fails to reflect the dynamic and developing forms of toxicity. In this paper, we consider toxic behavior as situated action, and seek to establish a taxonomy of toxic behaviors from a player perspective in League of Legends, currently one of the largest Esports games in the world. Our findings include five primary types of toxic behaviors, as well as five contextual factors that could lead to toxic behavior. In doing so, we provide a holistic, detailed account of toxic behavior in a team-based competitive gaming context, highlight the role of player perspective in explaining toxic behavior, and extend existing scholarly discussions on toxicity and moderation.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports on an ethnomethodology-informed ethnography of a video game museum. Based on 4 weeks of ethnographic fieldwork, we showcase how groups of visitors to the museum achieved the interactional work necessary to play games together and organise a museum visit as a social unit.  By showcasing and explication excerpts of museums visits we make the \"taken-for-granted'' nature of these interactions visible. Embedded within an activity map that outlines how people \"prepare\", \"play\", \"wind down\" and \"exit\" games, we showcase the sequential, temporal, and carefully negotiated character of these visits. Based on our findings and the resulting \"Machinery of Interaction\", we propose three design implications for spaces that aim to exhibit video games and/or try to facilitate co-located, collective video game play.",

      "abstract": "The increasingly popular social virtual reality (VR) is dramatically transforming how people meet, interact, and socialize online. These immersive digital spaces blend aspects of the online and offline worlds, creating new opportunities for online interactivity. Yet, questions still remain about what individuals actually do in social VR and how they envision and reflect on the design of social VR technologies. In this paper, we report our findings of an interview study (N=30)that investigated what made activities on these platforms meaningful to users as well as users’ recommendations for designing social VR to better support such activities. Our findings expand current literature on social dynamics and sociality in online digital spaces by focusing on social VR. We also inform future design directions to create more socially supportive and satisfying social VR space.",

      "abstract": "We have built and implemented a set of metaphors for breathing games by involving children and experts. These games are made to facilitate prevention of asthma exacerbation via regular monitoring of children with asthma through spirometry at home. \r\nTo instruct and trigger children to execute the (unsupervised) spirometry correctly, we have created interactive metaphors that respond in real-time to the child's inhalation and exhalation. Eleven metaphors have been developed in detail. Three metaphors have been fully implemented based on current guidelines for spirometry and were tested with 30 asthmatic children. Each includes multi-target incentives, responding to three different target values (inhalation, peak expiration, and complete exhalation). We postulate that the metaphors should use separate goals for these targets, have independent responses, and allow to also go beyond expected values for each of these targets. From the selected metaphors, most children preferred a dragon breathing fire and a soccer player kicking a ball into a goal as a metaphor; least liked were blowing seeds of a dandelion and applying lotion to a dog to grow its hair. Based on this project we discuss the potential and benefits of a suite-of-games approach: multiple games that each can be selected and adapted depending on personal capabilities and interests. ",

      "abstract": "The number of mainstream gaze-enabled games is rapidly increasing. They introduce gaze interactions based on the alignment of the eyes' focus on locations of interest. We challenge this traditional use of gaze and propose to play without looking. We developed KryptonEyed, a mini-game prototype that requires the player to close their eyes and perform eye movements behind the eyelids before opening them to aim with gaze for interaction. To validate the interaction mechanic and the game experience, we conducted two user studies. We evaluated the feasibility of using the proposed dynamic, its performance and the game experience. Results show how participants could successfully use the proposed gaze technique and overcome the game challenge. Based on our findings, we discuss the metaphors to ``not look\" for interaction and give directions to introduce the dynamic in gaze-enabled games.",

      "abstract": "In game-based curricula that leverage game design, students can learn creatively by transforming serious topics into video games (i.e., serious games). However, as these games remain mostly under-explored, we know little about how students design them and the extent to which they reflect content uptake. Here, we leverage a framework for serious games called Triadic Game Design (TGD) to analyze 391 games on climate science, which were designed by 8th-grade students with Scratch. Based on a large-scale TGD-based analysis, we provide an overview of design outcomes emerging from student games, and analyze how reality, meaning, and play are articulated in these games to reflect content uptake. Then, we ask two experts in game design and education to assess a subset of the 20 most representative games, to reflect on further design and pedagogical insights that may have not been captured by the large-scale analysis. Our results reveal a wide range of design outcomes, where Pong-like games teach players about the ice-albedo feedback loop, and CO2 molecules become targets to be shot in games like Space Invaders. Our work can serve as guidance and inspiration to help both researchers and educators evaluate student-designed games, as well as reason about how to use them as assessment tools in game-based constructionist curricula.",

      "abstract": "Designing for bodily play in HCI is increasingly gaining attraction, including research on the experiential dynamics leading to that. Within this research, however, there has been little investigation into the differences between bodily playing and bodily gaming and associated implications for design. This paper investigates such differences and proposes an understanding derived from the Danish linguistic connotations of the four different combinations of bodily \"playing/gaming” a “play/game\". We exemplify these through four different examples and extract four strategies for designers to implement in their future bodily designs. With our work, we hope we are able to expand the range of diverse bodily play and game experiences within HCI.",

      "abstract": "Iterative user-centred design has become a standard approach for developing interactive products. This process relies on prototyping and usertesting as early as possible to deliver a positive user experience and ensure that final products align with designers' intentions. The video game industry has benefited greatly from this design approach, with games user researchers adapting and introducing various evaluation techniques. However, repeatedly creating game builds suitable for usertesting (i.e., high-fidelity prototypes) is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, recruiting users and conducting evaluation sessions are labour-intensive tasks. These challenges are especially pressing in the evaluation of game level and world design, where designers may wish to evaluate many alternatives or rapidly measure the impact of many small design changes on a game's ability to deliver the intended experience. To support developers grappling with these challenges, we have developed PathOS, a novel tool for simulating testing sessions with agents that model player navigation. This paper reports on our development objectives, implementation, and a user study with professional game developers to assess PathOS' application in a level design context. Our results demonstrate the ability of an automated testing tool to enhance the workflow of practicing developers. ",

      "abstract": "Personalization is essential for gameful systems. Past research showed that the Hexad user types model is particularly suitable for personalizing user experiences. The validated Hexad user types questionnaire is an effective tool for scientific purposes. However, it is less suitable in practice for personalizing gameful applications, because filling out a questionnaire potentially affects a person's gameful experience and immersion within an interactive system negatively. Furthermore, studies investigating correlations between Hexad user types and preferences for gamification elements were survey-based (i.e.,not based on user behaviour). In this paper, we improve upon both these aspects. In a user study (N=147), we show that gameful applications can be used to predict Hexad user types and that the interaction behaviour with gamification elements corresponds to a users' Hexad type. Ultimately, participants perceived our gameful applications as more enjoyable and immersive than filling out the Hexad questionnaire.",

      "abstract": "Physiological sensing has been a prominent fixture in games user research (GUR) since the late 1990s, when researchers started to explore its potential to enhance and understand experience within digital game play. Since these early days, is has been widely argued that ``affective gaming''---in which gameplay is influenced by a player’s emotional state---can enhance player experience by integrating physiological sensors into play. Reflecting in 2020 on these last 20 years of progress, we systematically review the field of affective gaming to answer whether or not it has met this promise. We create a framework (the affective game loop) to classify 162 publications (included from an initial search set of 52,834 results) within affective gaming, present findings on the current state of the field, and discuss how our findings, contextualized within the affective game loop, can guide the future of affective gaming.

      "abstract": "The development of skill in games is of interest to players and designers. Spaced practice in games, i.e., adding breaks to core gameplay, has been shown to improve performance over playing continuously; however, it is unclear if the benefits of spaced practice apply in complex games that combine several skills and elements. Further, many break-like activities are already present in games (e.g., cutscenes, mini-games, leaderboards, loading screens) and we do not know whether engaging with these as breaks reduces the benefits of spaced practice. %, aside from something that is more `restful' than the task itself. \r\nWe built a custom 2D platform game in which players wall-jump, swing, %via a grapple hook and double-jump through an obstacle course and used it as the core gameplay activity in two experiments---one to test if spaced practice improves performance in a complex game, and another to determine how spaced practice is affected by the choice of in-game break activity. We show that spaced practice significantly improves skill development in a complex platformer game; that spaced practice is effective across several types of ecologically-valid break activities; and that the use of short breaks does not subvert flow states during play.

      "abstract": "Players, developers, and researchers generally agree that\r\n“cheating” to gain an unfair advantage over others fosters\r\nnegative player experiences. Despite social and experiential\r\nrepercussions and cheating’s negative stigma, the majority of\r\nplayers regularly cheat in some form. Fixation on cheating’s social\r\nand moral axes disservices understanding the ways in which\r\nplayers cheat in single-player settings, cheating’s potential\r\nbenefits, and cheating’s effects on player experience. Surveying\r\n188 U.S. players on their beliefs, preferences, and experiences of\r\ncheating in single-player contexts, mixed-methods analyses\r\nreveal that, unlike in multiplayer contexts, most players endorse\r\ncheating in single-player settings. They do so to facilitate mood\r\nrepair, stress relief, and flow, and to exercise agency over\r\nsatisfying their psychological needs during gameplay. Building off\r\nprior studies in support of cheating, we discuss the ludic,\r\ncognitive, and wellness benefits found, and argue against\r\nimposing the moral dilemmas of multiplayer cheating on single-player contexts.",

      "abstract": "Customization interfaces allow players to tailor character appearance to represent desired self-concepts, increasing character identification and contributing towards enjoyment. Yet, despite their ubiquity, such interfaces seldom allow modification of  non-player characters (e.g., in-game enemies). A between-subjects experiment (N=34) examined affective/cognitive responses to  customizing and destroying enemies in a custom-built game. Participants created characters representing either a positive (confidence) or negative (anxiety) self-concept, and subsequently destroyed it during gameplay. Players reported greater identification, attitudes, enjoyment, and reduction in negative affect (anxiety) when customizing characters representing confidence, whereas anxiety characters increased negative affect. Affective responses to destruction varied based on self-concept. Destroying confidence characters increased negative affect, whereas negative affect was slightly reduced after destroying anxiety characters. Both groups evaluated the game favorably and exhibited similar purchase intentions. Results suggest that players prefer creating enemies in their (ideal) image like they do their own avatars. Avenues for future research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Visualizations have become a relevant instrument in games user research and analytics as well as for players to facilitate the analysis of behavioral data, including the evaluation of spatial game metrics. A fundamental task in this respect is to understand how different metrics vary across the game environment and how they relate to each other. In this paper, we evaluate a visualization based on hexagonal binning paired with visual glyphs to represent multivariate information. To study how much information can be encoded in a reasonable manner we created variants with varying complexity and measured correctness and efficiency for different types of tasks through an online study (N = 197). Our results indicate that players appreciated the clear display of multivariate data but that correctness and efficiency were also largely influenced by the visual coding and the task at hand. Based on gained insights, we discuss implications for the design of such and similar gameplay visualizations.",

      "abstract": "While a player character in a game can experience all perceptual modalities, player senses are often limited, especially to the visual channel. As a result, many video games apply visual delegates that function as a substitution to enhance player perception and intensify the relation between player and player character. For instance, in first-person actions games, red colored edges on the screen layer visually inform the player of being hit and, to some extent, this visual feedback delegates the character's affect (i.e., pain) to the player's perception. Existing games apply such delegates in various forms. Yet, there is no systematic investigation or classification of these visual delegates resulting in a lack of understanding how to appropriately assign visual delegates to perceptual events in game design. Using a grounded theory-based approach, we systematically analyzed 102 character-centered video games. We collected 67 visual delegates and derived 12 associated groups of five basic perceptions. As a first, our work provides a systematic classification and collection that allows game designers to find appropriate visual delegates for character perceptions they want to trigger in players.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel simulation model that is able to predict the per-level churn and pass rates of Angry Birds Dream Blast, a popular mobile free-to-play game. Our primary contribution is to combine AI gameplay using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a simulation of how the player population evolves over the levels. The AI players predict level difficulty, which is used to drive a player population model with simulated skill, persistence, and boredom. This allows us to model, e.g., how less persistent and skilled players are more sensitive to high difficulty, and how such players churn early, which makes the player population and the relation between difficulty and churn evolve level by level. Our work demonstrates that player behavior predictions produced by DRL gameplay can be significantly improved by even a very simple population-level simulation of individual player differences, without requiring costly retraining of agents or collecting new DRL gameplay data for each simulated player.",

      "abstract": "Burn injuries are a significant public health challenge with the known consequences and long term problems including pain, permanent scarring and psychological trauma. Current available rehabilitation equipment is rudimentary, resource-intensive and lacks a human-centered design approach. Immersive Virtual Reality technologies may provide aid in this area, with prior studies showing positive effects that this technology has on reducing patient’s physical pain, psychological trauma and improving movement. This study recognises the need for customised, measurable and goal-directed rehabilitation for burn patients. By conducting two ideation design sessions with health workers (session 1), and burn survivors and their carers (session 2), this study highlights the participants' perspectives on VR for burn rehabilitation such as the importance of patient agency, heat and healthy scarring. This work contributes core themes from survivors and health professionals to the field of design and computer human interaction that could inform future iterations of VR burn rehabilitation applications.",

      "abstract": "The shape and function of the human hand are intimately linked to our interaction with the physical world and sets us apart from our evolutionary ancestors. In the digital age, our hands still represent our main form of interaction. We use our hands to operate keyboards, mice, trackpads, and game controllers. This modality, however, separates content display and interaction.\r\nIn this paper, we present Digital Gloves (DigiGlo), a system designed to evaluate the benefits of a unified hand display and interaction system. We explore this symbiosis in the context of gaming where users control games using hand gestures while the content is displayed on their bare hand. Building on established learning principles, we explore different hand gestures and other specially tailored interactions, through three carefully designed activities and two user studies. From these we show that this is an idea that has the potential to bring more intuitive, enjoyable, and effective gaming and learning experiences, and offer recommendations regarding how to better design such systems.",

A core factor of PX in VR games that has not been studied before (in relation to audio or otherwise) is time perception. Thus, we provide the first empirical exploration of how music affects time perception in a VR game. In a user study (N=64), we investigated the effects of music on PX and time perception (operationalized as retrospective time estimation).\r\nParticipants retrospectively perceived time to pass significantly quicker in the VR game when music was present, but reported no difference in PX components, including immersion. \r\nThis contributes to ongoing discourse on the surprising lack of music effects in VR games. \r\nMoreover, our results highlight the need to re-conceptualize our understanding of the relationship between time perception and immersion in games.",

      "abstract": "Loss aversion is a cognitive bias in which the negative feelings associated with prospective losses have a greater magnitude than the positive feelings of winning equivalent gains. Although well studied in behavioural economics, there is little understanding of whether and how it arises in game contexts. In games, the “magic circle” may free players from their held attitudes, especially because in-game losses and gains are virtual. On the other hand, experienced immersion and a desire to achieve may make in-game decisions similar to out-of-game contexts. Knowing whether cognitive biases like loss aversion affect players is important for game designers when they create decision points and choices for players. We carried out a study in a Zelda-style game with 18 decision points about wagering gold at different win:loss ratios. Our results show that despite the temporary and digital nature of the game world, and the virtual nature of the gold, players still exhibited a strong bias towards avoiding losses. Our findings imply that designers should understand and account for loss aversion when setting up risk and reward structures in their games.",

Food fabrication techniques are used to expand the design space of food preparation, and it is accomplished before the eating stage. Many products have introduced playful experiences to this preparation stage. However, we have not yet explored food fabrication techniques in the context of play in depth. This paper discusses the food preparation stage and how it can be designed to be playful by introducing several product cases. Using this knowledge, we further discuss how such methods can be applied to previous digital food fabrication techniques with our own example of a playful food fabrication approach. We aim to enable various stages of human--food interaction to be more playful by understanding food as a toy-like object that can be independent from or related to the eating stage. ",

      "abstract": "As the population ages, nursing homes (long term residential care facilities for older adults) are facing a crisis. Currently, there are too few people pursuing career opportunities in the field, which can be largely attributed to the negative stereotypes towards aging and nursing homes. Because young people, aged 10-14 years, are at a critical point where they are beginning to consider potential career paths, we investigate the impact of countering negative stereotypes on the attitudes of young people using a serious game. Journey Through Carington House is a point-and-click serious game for young people that focuses on providing positive experiences as a resident assistant in a nursing home environment. In this work, we present the game’s design and a study with 22 young people. We find that narrative in serious games can be a tool for influencing young peoples’ views of older adults, and to help them better understand nursing homes and consider them as future workplaces. ",

      "abstract": "Videogame players must negotiate their preferences and manage their identities within the infrastructural constraints of their respective gaming platforms. We studied the creation of usernames--the names players use to represent themselves in online videogames--to understand what happens when the demands of a game, platform, or service are at odds with gamers’ desires. Through a series of open-ended, semi-structured interviews (N=30) conducted with online videogame players, we found that usernames are co-constructed via a process of negotiation in which players adjust their ideal tags using a variety of adaptive strategies, or workarounds, to find suitable options. In response to unique name requirements, character limitations, language filters, and in-game moderation, workarounds such as tweaking preferred usernames, preemptively avoiding certain names, and keeping secondary choices as back-ups allowed players to satisfy some of their name preferences while still facilitating access to their gaming platform of choice.",

      "abstract": "Social gaze-based interactions in games form a timely field of research as they can enrich communicative acts within the game world. Apart from portraying gaze via realistic-looking characters, we deem that these aspects could also be applied to non-anthropomorphic characters found in so-called minimalist games. These games use simple mechanics and an abstract art style to convey deep and meaningful experiences. The paper examines concepts of social gaze in minimalist games via a comparative study that focuses on the players' perceived quality of social interaction towards abstract non-player characters. By creating a game made up of three levels, it is aimed to uncover differences between the inclusion and exclusion of gaze-aware characters. The results show that the integration of gaze-based social interactions led to a positive social experience among players. Social gaze in this context is not superfluous but adds a crucial element in the interpretation of game objects: Players in the gaze condition tended to see the abstract entities as characters instead of lifeless game objects.",

      "abstract": "The feeling of lying in the restricted bore of an MRI scanner, surrounded by loud noises and not allowed to move, is a psychological burden for patients. Children especially have problems to lie still during the examination and sometimes exhibit intense fear reactions. Therefore, children are frequently sedated before the examination. We introduce the concept and implementation of a virtual reality (VR) game as a medication-free alternative for children, aiming to reduce anxiety, stress, and boredom during MRI examinations. Playing or just watching an animated space story in VR provides distraction and relaxation to the patients. We pursued a child-centered, participatory design process and derived design requirements from the results of two workshops with children in a hospital school (N = 15) and a primary school (N = 14), as well as a focus group test with a prototype. We propose VR games as a solution to enhance the well-being of children during medical interventions and show a way to approach a user-centered and targeted game design.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Combat systems are a fundamental part of computer role-playing games (RPGs). Popular media articles and online discussions suggest that players have very strong opinions on combat styles, in particular, whether they like RPGs with real-time or turn-based combat systems. However, there is little scientific research into this question. With our research we aim to systematically explore combat style preferences and determine the underlying reasons for preferring certain types over others. To this end, we analyzed a set of online discussions (546 posts) with regard to three broad combat system categories: Real-Time (RT), Turn-Based (TB), and Real-Time with Pause (RTwP). Our results suggest that while most players indeed do have a preference for one combat style, most players are still largely or completely open to other styles of combat. We furthermore identify common positive and negative traits of different combat styles and discuss implications for combat design.",

      "abstract": "Watching others play is a key ingredient of digital games and an important aspect of games user research. However, spectatorship is not very popular in virtual reality, as such games strongly rely on one's feelings of presence. In other words, the head-mounted display creates a barrier between the player and the audience. We contribute an alternative watching approach consisting of two major components: a dynamic view frustum that renders the game scene from the current spectator position and a one-way mirror in front of the screen. This mirror, together with our silhouetting algorithm, allows seeing the player's reflection at the correct position in the virtual world. An exploratory survey emphasizes the overall positive experience of the viewers in our setup. In particular, the participants enjoyed their ability to explore the virtual surrounding via physical repositioning and to observe the blended player during object manipulations. Apart from requesting a larger screen, the participants expressed a strong need to interact with the player. Consequently, we suggest utilizing our technology as a foundation for novel playful experiences with the overarching goal to transform the passive spectator into a collocated player.",

      "abstract": "VR allows users to embody any possible avatar. Previous work found that the appearance of avatars can change our perception and behavior. Such behavioral changes based on stereotypical assessments are known as the Proteus effect. Exergames involve physical activities of players, however, it is currently unknown if behavioral changes caused by an avatar’s appearance can affect players' performance in physically engaging tasks. Therefore, we conducted a study with 30 participants to determine the effect of avatars' muscularity on physical performance and perception of effort. We found that participants in muscular avatars had a lower perceived exertion during an isometric force task. Furthermore, male participants embodying a muscular avatar had a higher grip strength. Results suggest that embodying avatars associated with power and strength can decrease the perception of effort and enhance physical performance. We discuss how body ownership, user identification, and gender moderate avatars' effects.",

      "abstract": "Taking effective notes is an important skill in academic and professional settings and one that is cultivated primarily in Higher Education (HE). However, students often find it difficult to effectively record important information in their notes [37], while it has been suggested that they often record less than 50% of the key information of a lecture [15].  \r\n\r\nGames can be a powerful way to help students learn [30]. Yet, to date, there is scarce empirical research on games specifically designed to help HE students develop note-taking skills where the design has been directly informed by note-taking learning theories. This study applies such theories in the design of the mechanics for an educational game for note-taking, entitled Investigate: Tudors, and evaluates their effectiveness and engaging potential.  \r\n\r\nResults from qualitative evaluations with HE students showed that the game was a successful tool to help them develop note-taking skills. This article discusses the game design approach and the evaluation results, and contributes with effective strategies for designing serious games for note-taking. ",

      "abstract": "This paper broadens understanding of intuitive use in games by testing the influence of three naturally mapped motion control interfaces in the context of a tennis video game. It also extends exploratory work on natural mapping and intuitive interaction in video games by refining instruments to measure game technology familiarity. Repeated-measures experiment data (N = 120) is analysed via mixed ANOVAs with four distinct player characteristic variables. As with broader intuitive interaction research, results show that more familiar players performed more effectively; however, where differences exist, they point towards increased intuitive use gains with more naturally mapped control interfaces. Subjective measures suggest that control interfaces were perceived as more intuitive when they had higher levels of natural mapping, yet also point to the influencing roles of familiarity and the dimensions of the control types in shaping these perceptions.",

Tasked with making burgers, players must prepare the food while ensuring it is safe to eat, engaging explicitly and implicitly with challenges related to regulatory compliance and derived from UK legislation, but also efficient and ethical decision making; washing hands, placing rat traps, hiring appropriate help, time saving and money making. Interviewing nineteen players with professional involvement in food preparation reveals a diversity of perceived alignment with participants’ everyday real-world practice that ranges from rules to be gamed to serious concerns. We contribute an examination of how the game, combined with a study protocol that further prompted debriefing and  reflection, demonstrates opportunities for training, reflection and engagement with the subject matter. We consider how fidelity and immersion allow comparisons between gameplay and real world compliance.",

      "abstract": "This paper endeavors to explain how and why self-presentation can affect in-game purchase behavior in Fortnite. As one of the most popular battle royale games in the world, Fortnite employs a free-to-play business model but enjoys a high revenue by selling skins and cosmetics. Using an online survey (N=247), Study 1 explores how Fortnite players' play patterns and three theoretical dimensions of self-presentation (identifiability, self-presence, and self-disclosure) are correlated to actual spending behavior. Study 2 is an interview study (N=11) that further investigates impacts of self-presentation on players’ in-game purchase behaviors. Results indicate that higher identifiability, less self-disclosure, and playing alone were positively associated with the amount of money that players spent. In addition, self-presentation could affect in-game spending behaviors from five main aspects: a high demand for uniqueness, a desire to establish self-presence, a pursuit for aesthetics, indicating status as a gameplay strategy, and a highlight of community identity. Our findings not only provide new empirical evidence of nuanced self-presentation practices in spending behavior in online survival games but also inform future research on designing effective game mechanisms and engaging gaming experiences.",

      "abstract": "This review examines 103 existing gamified fitness tracker apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store that motivate users to walk more. We consider different types of game elements in these mobile app games and show how they cluster into different game genres. We found co-occurrences of various game elements including Competition, Challenges, and Social Influence. Social features played a central role in nearly every type of gamified fitness tracker app, where a sub-category  of games with real-world incentives emerged. Content and network analysis are used to suggest new areas of the design space that are unexplored, but potentially fruitful, such as plot-based collaborative games.",

      "abstract": "Much topical gamification research has focused on the application of personality trait models and the development of player typologies. These models are often applied under the assumption that personality or gamification user type reside as a stable construct within the individual. However, the preference for gamification strategies as well as their motivational impact, may vary in different contexts and situations. Therefore, our study aimed to disambiguate the different levels of motivation (global, contextual and situational) underlying preferences for gamification strategies, in the specific domain of pro-environmental behaviour. To this end, we developed a gamified mobile app to promote pro-environmental behaviour. Next, 56 participants interacted with the app during on average 22 days, while logs with various game elements were collected. Additionally, participants filled out the Hexad questionnaire to establish gamification user type, a survey polling for intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation towards the environment, and two questionnaires to assess pro-environmental behaviour before and after app usage. Our findings suggest that particularly intrinsic motivation towards the environment predicts preferences for gamification strategies whereas gamification user types fall short. In sum, our study lends support to measuring at different levels of motivation to understand and tailor gamification strategies for pro-environmental behaviour. ",

      "abstract": "In this project, we explore the intersection of improvisational theater and Twitch live streaming. Improv offers social affordances to live streams, while streaming offers improv performers a way to both broaden their reach to non-copresent audiences and create new types of participatory improv games. Based on insights from both domains, we present StAGE, a live streaming system that both communicates performative information otherwise lost when streaming live theater and accommodates participatory roles for performers, hosts, and audiences. Using our system, we created and playtested four improv game prototypes exploring a range of interactions. We show that StAGE affords novel interactions both as a streaming experience and as improvisational theater. We propose that the social transfer of roles and information, particularly by hosts, is a critical aspect of the design. We conclude by discussing newly discovered challenges and potential for the future of the intersection of these domains.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative virtual agents are often deployed to help users make decisions in real-time. For this collaboration to work, users must adequately trust the agents that they are interacting with. In my research, I use a game where human-agent interactions are recorded via a logging system and survey instruments in order to explore this trust relationship. I then study the impact that different agents have on reliance, performance, cognitive load and trust. I seek to understand which aspects of an agent influence the development of trust the most. With this research, I hope to pave the way for trust-aware agents, capable of adapting their behaviours to users in real-time.",

      "abstract": "GLAM institutions have increasingly incorporated visitor experiences into their space as a way to position themselves in the \"experience economy\", and approach the ideals of \"immersive heritage\" and sensory museuology. The ludic turn - i.e. the introduction of play in the GLAM space - has been identified as one of the key turns that assists GLAM institutions to move towards those ideals. However, play, and the appropriation it bring in the space, can be disruptive. Following a research-through-design method, the focus of this Ph.D. research is to explore how to design experiences that use tangible interactions and digital technologies that facilitate play and appropriation in the GLAM space, along with providing insights on ways that this appropriation can be used to redesign the experience. To explore that topic, an empirical study along with four design experiments are conducted in the space of the Danish Architecture Centre.",

      "abstract": "Let’s Plays (or LPs) are recordings of video gameplay with commentary from the player, that are then shared online for others to view. The creation and sharing of Let’s Play content has grown significantly over the last decade. Several of the most popular channels on YouTube, with millions of subscribers consuming their content on a daily basis, feature LPs. However, while there is some research on the ways by which YouTube content creators operate, the origins of LP as a genre/paratextual artifact, and by extension the community that originated its practice, have not been fully documented. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for scholars to fully comprehend the historical context of this form of creative expression, and the influence it has had on contemporary online entertainment media.\r\nTo address this, the first and longest running LP community, the Something Awful LP subforum, will be examined through data analysis and ethnographic approaches. Part of this work will be to analyze and define LP as a paratextual artifact, and how the cultural practices of the community produce those artifacts. With those concepts in place, this research will then examine how platform systems, such as YouTube, the Something Awful forums, and streaming services, have changed the ways in which LPs are created, shared, and engaged with by the community. By documenting the history of the LP community, the reasons why people join it, and the practices by which they make LPs, future scholars and companies will be better equipped to engage with these growing communities.\r\n",

      "abstract": "New technologies are intensively present in the daily life of the average human being. Internet, smartphones, and high-performance personal computers allow innumerous interactions between people and technologies. Although these changes are not immediately noticeable, they have a profound impact on the way people behave and act upon society [1].\r\nIt is possible to analyze subjective changes promoted by technological advancement in terms of identity, narrative, relation, media, labor, and several other categories [2; 3]. These categories are connected in several different ways.\r\nThis research centers on labor as a category since it is a polysemic concept, which does not belong to a specific subject. Labor is a powerful articulator among numerous types of knowledge. To better comprehend and analyze the job, it is necessary to overview all the context involved, such as the actions of those who are engaged, organizations structures, and individual and collective relationships.\r\nThe insertion of technology in labor practices has impactful transformations, with demands in different new ways on the workers and the collectivity [4]. This labor´s analysis seeks to comprehend the activity in its social and instrumental aspects.\r\nThis investigation centers on a job modality that was born in digital platforms, although it connects deeply to non-digital activities. The advance of communication technologies allowed a new kind of labor to arise: the professional player of digital games. \r\nSocial media, television, and some academic productions use the term \"eSports,\" short for electronic sports, in the context of professional digital games. Jensen defines eSports as \"a competitive way to play video games in a professional environment\" [5, p. 18].\r\nTraditional sports (which have a lot of value for the physical effort) and intellectual ones (such as chess) do not include eSports as part of them, which leaves the latter category on the edge of the above fields [6]. The same comparison can be applied on labor field. The activity of an eSports professional player is considerably different from a traditional sports player. Although this activity appears to be like the digital labor, they are not in the same field of work since the former does not require specific technical knowledge.\r\n",

      "abstract": "With the rising popularity of VR technologies, more people are experiencing what this medium has to offer. Right now, the most popular games are either single-player or online-multiplayer, leaving the people in the same room without a way of interacting with the HMD (Head Mounted Display) player. For VR to become mainstream, this problem has to be solved. A preliminary experiment was conducted in which two different ways of including a second person in the VR experience (through a PC or a Phone) were compared in terms of co-presence and immersion. Results showed that both ways are valid and can be used to add a second player --- the quantitative data gathered from two surveys (Networked Minds Measure of Social Presence for co-presence and iGroup Presence Questionnaire for Immersion) showed that there was no significant difference, and the qualitative data, which revealed 13 distinct themes divided into five categories, helped with understanding the survey results. The next steps are to concentrate on one of the categories (embodiment) and conducting a systematic review into ways of increasing it, followed by expert interviews to confirm the findings and create a definitive list of factors that affect embodiment. Finally, a second experiment will be conducted in order to confirm the validity of the factors.",

      "abstract": "Data visualization is often used in computer gaming to provide feedback to players. However, little research has investigated its potential in hybrid physical/digital tabletop games, or for tabletop role-playing games. Building upon the benefits of tangible interfaces we introduce and report on the design of the Truesight Battle Grid, a modular, tangible battle grid for the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Through visualizing game-play possibilities with lights, it aims to provide players with information about the fantasy world without being distracting. We report on a preliminary evaluation with two focus groups - showing that the tool was helpful and is able to contribute to an engaged audience - and reflect on possibilities for future work. ",
